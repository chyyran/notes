# 2021-03-23 Evidentiality

* not every salient in English
  * many languages have evidentiality  grammaticalized 
* phenomenon related o speech acts rather than modality
* allow us to talk about the source of evidence for the statement
  * "I heard that Jess quit her job"
  * "It looks like we're out of milk"
  * "Reportedly, Jess quit her job"
* mostly expressed with lexical item (verbs, adverbs) in English
  * らしい
  * example from quecha
    * Para-sha-n-si.
      * rain-PROG-3-si
      * 'It's raining'
      * Prejacent: It's raining
      * Evidential: I heard that it's raining
* epistemic 'must' may have  (inferential) evidential meaning
  * 'it must be raining'
    * not on direct evidence, otherwise you would say it's raining
* at what level is evidential meaning encoded?
  * at issue (that which can be denied/agreed with)
  * semantic presupposition?
  * modification of the illocutionary force of an at
  * answer we wnt to give is language dependent
    * cross-linguistic variation on how evidentiality is realized
