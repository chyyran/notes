# 2021-04-06 Tense

* simple theory of tense
* Tense used to locate topic time (TT) with respect to the time of utterance (TU)
  * TU: time when speaker makes the utterance, usually 'now'
* "This morning, Jess wrote an email to his mother"
  * TT is some interval during the morning
  * TT is before TU
  * TT includes time of writing email (TSit)
  * TT < TU
* Three ways of describing tense
  * Present: TT = TU
  * Past: TT < TU
  * Future: TT > TU
* Three tenses expressed by a combination of inflections and auxilliaries in English
  * PRE: I believe in you
    * First person, singular agreement characteristic of present tense
      * I do
      * You do
      * She do**es**
      * They do
  * PST: I believ**ed** in you.
  * FUT: I **will** believe in you.
  * Also combine with grammatical aspct
    * "Jess is smoking" (present progressive)
      * TT = TU & TT \(\subseteq\) TSit
    * "Jess is happy" (present stative)
      * TT = TU & TT \(\subseteq\) TSit
    * "Jess was smoking" (past progressive)
      * TT < TU & TT \(\subseteq\) TSit
    * "Jess smoked" (past unmarked aspect with dynamic predicate -- perfective)
      * TT < TU & TSit \(\subseteq\) TT
    * "Jess will  be smoking" (future progressive)
      * TT > TU & TT \(\subseteq\) TSit
    * "Jess will be happy" (future stative)
      * TT > TU & TT \(\subseteq\) TSit 
    * "Jess will smoke" (future, unmarked with dynamic predicate -- perfective)
      * TT > TU & TSit \(\subseteq\) TT
* Embedded tense in English
  * "Jess said [that she will leave]"
    * 'That she will leave' is embedded under 'said'
    * **matrix verb** 'said' is PST
    * embedded verb 'will leave' is in FUT
  * Past-under-present
    * Past tenses embedded under present tense are not problematic
    * 'Jess believes that Alex left'
      * embedded past locates TT before TU
      * time of leaving is included in embedded TU
      * embedded TT (time that Alex leaves) precedes TU
  * Past-under-future
    * 'Jess will say that Alex left'
      * time of leaving is included in embedded TT
      * embedded TT **precedes** time of Jess' report
      * **embedded TT does not have to precede TU**
      * TT has to occur before TSit (time of Jess saying!), but not TU
      * embeded TT **locates time of matrix verb**, not time of utterance
  * Past-under-past
    * Can not have a **forward-shifted** interpretation
    * 'Jess said that Alex left'
      * Alex's leaving can not be after Jess' report
      * '?Last week, Jess said that Alex left yesterday' is ungrammatical
        * 'Last week, Jess said that Alex would leave yesterday'
          * Future-under-past
    * Allows **back-shifted** interpretation
      * TU is before TT_m, and embedded TT (TT_e) is before that
      * 'Yesterday, Jess told me that Alex left a week ago'
        * Alex's leaving precedes Jess' report (TT_m/TSit)
      * This suggests that embedded PST is interpreted with respect to matrix TSit
        * insufficient analysis due to **simultaneous interpretation**
    * Simultaneous interpretation
      * 'Yesterday, Jess told me she was sick'
        * Jess' being sick is simultaneous to her report
        * can not be analyzed as past with respect to TSit
        * In this case, TT_m = TT_e
          * "Yesterday, Jess told me: 'I am sick'"
        * 'was' here introduces past TT equal to embedded and matrix TT
          * still relative to the matrix TSit
      * **always locates TT before TU**
        * John **decided** a week ago that in ten days at breakfast he **would** say to his mother that they **were** having their last meal together.
          * The last past tense denotes a future time!
          * This time is simultaeneous with the time of saying event.
          * 'were' is interpreted simultaneous to 'would' (say)
            * PST interpreted as 'relative present'
            * morphologically past, but not past at all
          * known as *sequence of tense*
            * simultaneous interpretation is licensed by the embedding under another past tense
* The model of tense here is a good model for what goes on in matrix clauses
  * Once we move to tense in embedded clauses things get weirder with our model
* Tenseless languages
  * tensed languages require presence of tense-marking morphemes that locate situations in time, whether or not similar temporal information is conveyed by other temporal expressions.
  * mandarin chinese
    * verbs are not inflected for tense or aspect
    * need not co-occur with a temporal, aspectual, or modal marker
    * is a grammar of temporality, but does not use grammatical tense
    * for stative sentences, present time reference expressed by an unmarked verb, adj, or nominal
      * Now I don't believe in God
        * 我現在不信神
    * unmarked dynamic verbs are compatible with a present habitual interpretation
      * I jog (everyday)
        * 我天天慢跑
      * Progressive interpretation available with 'zai'
        * I am jogging
        * 我在慢跑
      * 在 compatible with past and future adverbs
        * can use progressive marker without PST marker
        * 我昨天this time (zhei-ge)(sihou)在慢跑
    * unmarked dynamic predicates are compatible with PST
      * default interpretation for dynamic predicates are PST
    * perfective 了 and experiential marker may be added 
  * bare stative predicates not compatible with PST interpretation
    * xiaoming hen congming
      * Xiaoming is very smart
  * future tense uses modal operators
    * (hui) 
    * except for predicates or planned events
      * similar to english
      * 'train leaves at 3:00' vs 'train will leave at 3:00'
  * mandarin chinese has an **aspect based system**
    * atelic/imperfective/stative predicates have present interpretation by default
    * telic/perfective predicates have past interpretation by default
