# 2021-04-06 Grammatical Aspect


* tense vs aspect
* most sentences make comments about what goes on at a time
* the time the sentence is about is *topic time*
  * A: What did you see **when you entered the room**?
    * A's question sets up TT of 'time when B entered the room'
  * B: There **was** a book on the table.
    * B's sentence is about the TT A set up (in the past)
* Tense used to locate topic time (TT) with respect to the time of utterance (TU)
  * TU: time when speaker makes the utterance, usually 'now'
* Grammatical aspect gives information on how the event or state described by the VP relates to TT
  * Locations time of the event or state described by the verb (situation time, TSit) with respect to TT
    * Is TSit included in TT?
    * Is TT included in TSit?
* 'There was a book on the table'
  * Past(There is a book on the table)
  * TT < TU & TT \(\subseteq\) TSit
  * State of book on the table is included in the topic time
  * The book was already there before you walked in (and probably afterwards)
  * In this case, the topic time is included in the time of the situation
* Two important aspects
  * Progressive
  * Perfective
* Progressive Aspect
  * in English, marked morphologically a BE V-ing
    * June is laughing
      * PRE + PRG
    * June will be laughing
      * FUT + PRG
    * June was laughing
      * PST + PRG
  * progressive aspect conveys that there was an event going on at the topic time
    * TT is included in TSit
  * "When I saw her, June **was reading a book**"
    * TT < TU & TT \(\subseteq\) TSit
    * When I saw June (in the past), the event of June reading a book was ongoing
    * the only thing we know is that the moment of me seeing June is included in the **interval TSit**
      * We don't know if TSit extends to the present
      * We know that TSit began before TT.
      * 'I guess she's still reading it now'
  * "Right now, Mary is reading the newspaper"
    * TSit is bigger than the topic time
    * Time of event of reading includes TT (present time)
    * TSit extends into both past and present indeterminately
* Perfective aspect
  * Locates TSit within TT.
  * TSit \(\subseteq\) TT
  * TSit ends before TT 
  * "Tomorrow, Mary will mow the lawn"
    * TT is tomorrow
    * Mary will **finish** mowing the lawn before tomorrow (TT) ends
  * "Yesterday, Mary mowed the lawn"
    * TT is yesterday
    * Mary finished mowing the lawn before yesterday ends
    * "?Maybe she's still mowing it" is odd.
      * cf. "Yesterday, Mary was mowing the lawn, maybe she's still mowing it."
* Unmarked aspect
  * In English, verbs can occur without morphological aspect
    * June smokes
      * PRE
    * June smoked
      * PST
    * June will smoke
      * FUT
  * There are different ways to interpret the aspect of such sentences
    * Habitual: June smokes
    * Habitual: For many years, Jess played soccer.
    * Perfective: This morning, Jess played soccer.
  * Sometimes perceived as perfective
    * Yesterday, Mary mowed the lawn
    * Tomorrow, Mary will mow the lawn
  * Sometimes habitual or repetitive
    * Habitual: John smokes
    * Repetitive: The light flashed for 10 minutes
    * Repetitive: The light will flash for 10 minutes
  * Stative predicates
    * Stative predicates do not occur in progressive
      * ?John is being happy
      * John is happy
        * TT is included in state of happiness (TSit)
    * Stative predicates with unmarked aspect are not interpreted perfectively
      * not really progressive aspect, but we still have TT \(\subseteq\) TSit
      * stative predicates with unmarked aspect simply convey that the state they described is going on at the topic time
* Imperfective aspect
  * Many languages use same morphology for progressive and habitual aspect
  * In such languages, progressive aspect is a type of imperfective aspect
  * "Juan fuma-ba."
    * Juan smoke-PST.IMPFV
    * "Juan was smoking/used to smoke"
