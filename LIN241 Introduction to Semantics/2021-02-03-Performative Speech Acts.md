# 2021-02-03 Performative Speech Acts

* Consider a sentence like "Go get me a coffee"
  * This sentence does not have a 'truth value' per se
* Some types of sentences do not have a truth-condition
  * Imperatives
    * "Go get me a coffee"
  * Interrogatives
    * "Are you okay?"
  * The meaning of such sentences consists of the kind of action that they can be used to perform
  * Even declarative sentences can be performative, and do not have a truth conditional
    * I sentence you to 5 years of labour
    * I apologize
  * Such sentences are said to be **performative**
    * The primary meaning of these sentences are to do something when said in a appropriate context
    * appear to have truth conditions 
      * "I apologize" is true iff the speaker apologizes
      * The act of saying "I apologize" is sufficient as an apology
* Performative sentences form
  * First person subject
    * I apologize
    * He apologizes (not performative)
  * Present tense
    * I apologize
    * I apologized (not performative)
  * Performative verb
    * I hereby apologize
    * #I hereby make you love semantics
* Non-performative declarative sentences are called **constatives**
  * Even constatives can be use to perform actions
  * By asserting a proposition, a speaker commits to behave as if they believe the proposition to be true
  * If the proposition is false, the speaker can be accused of lying
  * Assertion a proposition is a **action** with **social consequences**
    * "There was no money in the wallet"
  * The meaning is not just the truth condition!
* All types of sentences are used to perform actions called **speech acts**
  * declaratives (constatives and performatives)
  * interrogatives
  * imperatives
* How is the truth-conditional semantics of S used in a speech act performed by an utterance of S?
* Does the truth-conditional meaning of S constrain which speech acts can be performed by S?
* Relationship between sentences (sentence types) and speech acts?
  * 1:1? No
  * Nature of the relationship?
  * Purely conventional relation?
  * Grammar interactions
* Speech acts
  * Locutionary act: act of uttering the sentence
  * Illocutionary act: action performed by uttering the sentence
    * synonymous with 'speech act'
  * Perlocutionary act: act realized by consequence of the Locutionary and Illocutionary acts
    * Indirect consequence of locutionary and illocutionary acts
* Example
  * Jess shouts at Chris:
    * J: (S) "Go get me a coffee right now!"
    * Chris punches Jess in the nose
  * J's locutionary act: uttering (S)
  * J's illocutionary act: giving an order to Chris
  * C's perlocutionary act: Jess angers Chris
* Felicity conditions
  * What conditions must be satisfied for this to count a a promise?
    * "I promise I will come tomorrow"
  * Rules of promising (Searle 1969)
    1. Promise P is to be uttered only in the context of a sentence (or large stretch of discourse) the uttering of which predicates some future act A of the speaker S.
       * Promises must be for the future 
       * Propositional content rule
    2. P is to be uttered only if the hearer H would prefer S's doing A to his not doing A, and S believes H would prefer S's doing A to his not doing A
        * Promises must be nice things that are desirable
        * If not, it is a *threat*
        * Prepatory rule
    3.  P is to be uttered only if it is not obvious to both S and H that S will do A in the normal course of events.
        * Promises can not be trivial  
        * Prepatory rule 
    4. P is to be uttered only if S intends to do A
        * The promiser must intend to fulfill the promise
        * Sincerity rule
    5. The utterance of P counts as the undertaking of an obligation to do A
       * The promiser must commit to the promise
       * Essential rule
* Constutitive rules for speech acts
  * propositional content rule
    * what proposition can be used to make the speech act?
  * prepatory rule
    * in what context can one make the speech act?
  * sincerity rule
    * what is the intention of the speaker when making the speech act?
  * essential rule
    * what does the speech act commit the speaker to?
* different illocutionary acts
  * representatives 
    * commit the speaker to the truth of the spoken proposition
  * directives
    * attempts to get the addressee to do something (requests, questioning)
  * commissives
    * commits the speaker to some future action (threats, promises offers)
  * expressives
    * expesses a psychological state (thanking, apologizing)
  * declarations
    * effect immediate changes in the state of affairs (declaring war, excommunication)
    * may rely on elaborate extralinguistic institutions
* speech acts are performed by uttering sentences with Searle's set of rules
* conventionalism
  *  conventions relate different types of sentences with a type of speech act
  * A single sentence can sometimes perform many types of speech acts
  * becasue of this, we're not sure if it is related to sentence
* Indirect speech acts
  * speech acts performed by an implicature
    * "You should move your bicycle"
    * implicature: your bicycle may be stolen
* "Can you pass the salt?"
  1. Y asked me a question about my ability to pass the salt
  2. Assume that Y is cooperating in the conversation, so his utterance has some goal
  3. The setting is not such as to indicate a theoretical interest in salt-passing ability 
    * common ground
  4. Y probably already knows the answer to the question is yes
    * common ground
  5. from (4), the utterance is probably not just a question. There is some ulterior illocutionary point
  6. Theory of speech acts: a prepatory condition for directive illocutionary acts is the ability of H to perform the act predicated
  7. Y has asked a question to which the affirmative answer would entail the prepatory condition for requesting me to pass the salt is satisfied
     * Confirm, assert the ability to pass the salt
  8. We are at dinner, and people normally use salt at dinner, passing it back and forth
  9. Y has therefore alluded to the satisfaction of a prepatory condition for a request whose obedience conditions it is likely they want to bring about (steps 7, 8)
  10. In the absence of other plausible illocutionary points, they are likely requesting me to pass them the salt (steps 5, 9)
  * Direct SA: question, indirect SA: request
* Conventional implicatures
  * do not confuse conversational implicatures with conventional implicatures
  * Grice: conventional meanings of the words used determine what is implicated, besides helping to determine what is said (literally)
  * unlike simple entailments
    * not **at-issue**
      * 'at-issue' meaning is the main point of an utterance
      * not at-issue meaning isn't targeted by simple denials
        * A: Chris is English and therefore brave
          B: That's not true!
            * Not denying the connection between being English and brave
        * A: That jerk Winston survived the incident
          B: That's not true!  
            * Not denying that Winston is a jerk
      * isn't targeted by simple assent
        * A: Chris is English and therefore brave
          B: I agree!
            * Not agreeing with the connection between English and brave
        * A: That jerk Winston survived the incident
          B: That's correct
            * Not agreeing that Winston is a jerk
     * isn't targeted by questioning
        * Is Chris English and therefore brave
          * Not questioning the connection between English and brave
        * Did that jerk Winston survive the incident?
          * Not questioning if Winston is a jerk
    * Survive negation and questioning
      * Chris is English and therefore brave
        * It's not true that Chris is English and therefore brave
        * Is Chris English and therefore brave?
        * Conventional implicature: English people are brave
      * That jerk Winston survived the incident
        * That jerk Winston didn't survive the incident
        * Did that jerk Winston survive the incident?
        * Conventional implicature: Winston is a jerk
  * unlike presuppositions
    * speaker oriented
      * Chris is English and therefore brave
        * English => brave is the speaker's opinion
      * That jerk Winston survived the incident
        * Winston is a jerk is the speaker's opinion
      * Jess stopped smoking
        * Presupposition: Jess used to smoke
        * Speaker assumes Jess' smoking is common ground
    * very tenuous line between presupposition and conventional implicatures
  * unlike conversational implicatures
    * not cancellable
      * Chris is English and therefore brave, #although I don't think that English people tend to be brave
      * That jerk Winston survived the incident, #but I don't think he's a jerk
    * not reinforceable
      * Chris is English and therefore brave, #and I think that English people tend to be brave
      * That jerk Winston survived the incident, #and he's a jerk
    * not calculated, but conventional
      * conventional implicature of 'but'
        * Truth-meaning is AND
        * at-issue meaning is just that of conjunction
        * conventional meaning is that there is contrast between cheap and good
        * must be learned lexically
  * Triggers
    * Nominal appositives
      * Ames, **the former spy**, is now behind bars
    * Parenthetical adverbial clauses
      * Ames was, **as the press reported**, a successful spy
    * Non-restrictive relative clauses
      * Ed's claim, **which is based on extensive research**, is highly controversial
      * I spent part of every summer until I was ten with my grandmother, **who lived in a working-class suburb of Boston**
    * Evaluative adverbs
      * **Fortunately,** Jess lucked out
      * **Inexplicably,** Chris wrote a crystal clear report
    * Speech act adverbials

    * Expressive attributes adjectives
      * My **fucking** bike tire is flat again!
    * Epithets
      * Every politician advocating a proposal for reform says the **stupid** thing is worthwhile
* Ways of making speech acts
  * **querying** prepatory condition
