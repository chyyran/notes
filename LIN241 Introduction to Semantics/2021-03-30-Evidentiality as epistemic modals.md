# 2021-03-30 Evidentiality as epistemic modals

* Evidentiality as an epistemic modal
  * Lillooet/St'at'imcets
  * Reportative evidential
    * ku7: reportative
    * k'a: inferential
      * 'must have'
      * はず
    * -an': perceived evidence
      * something you've seen
      * 'looks like'
      * みたい
* ku7
  * reportative evidential
  * committed to the truth of the prejacent
  * utterance of `[p ku7]` is not felicitous (utterance is odd) if speaker believes p is false
  * in quecha, the reporative  `[-si]` is still felicitous if the speaker believes p is false
    * difference
  * not at issue -- `[p ku7]` can be challenged based on rejection of the source of the evidence
    * challenge the evidential proposition rather than the prejacent proposition
    * 'I was told that we chose Roger to be chief' -- 'No you weren't [told that]'
  * can be embdedded
    * can be interpreted in the scope of a verb of saying
    * 'said that [she was told that] P'
    * based on hearsay evidence that she knows P
  * projects below negation
    * '[I was told] there was no water here'
    * can not be 'I was not told there was water here'
  * epistemic modal
    * like 'must'
    * imposes a presupposition on the epistemic modal base
    * the utterance is true for a set of worlds that agree with the modal
  * '[I heard] there are trout in the creek'
    * equiv in english: "There must be trout in the creek"
    * assertion: every world that is compatible with info available to the speaker is a world in which there are trout in the creek
    * presupposition: information that is available to the speaker in this context is based only on what the speaker was told
  * prejacent proposition presented as a belief of the speaker
    * speaker is committed to the truth of the proposition
  * epistemic modality is part of the asserted proposition
    * necessity can be challenged
    * necessity can be embedded
  * evidential operator is necessarily epistemic
    * necessity epistemic modals tend to have high scope over negation in many languages
* should you think of an epistemic modal as illocutionary or as a modal operator?
  * conceptual differences has non-trivial consequences
