* In English, verb and adjectives describe states and events
  * Predicates that describe states
    * 'The kitchen *was empty*'
    * 'Susan *knows Russian*'
  * Predicates that describe events
    * 'Karim *woke up*'
    * 'Bella is *fixing the engine*'
  * events are not static, they are dynamic situations
* stative predicates are non-dynamic and homogenous
  * subject is presented as having a property or quality through a temporal interval
  * non-dynamic--possession of the quality or property does not involve change through time
  * homogenous: if the subject is in a state throughout an interval, it is in the state at all parts of the interval
* events are dynamic
  * processes that unfold throughout time
  * changes of state from one state to another
  * types of events
    * punctual and have a duration    
      * 'arrive at the station' (punctual, non durative)
      * 'walk in the park' (durative)
    * have an expected terminal point (telos)
      * eat an apple (telic)
        * when the apple is eaten, the event must stop
      * eat apples (atelic)
* aktionsart
  * classification of predicates as predicates of state or of events
  * discussion of different types of event predicates
  * classified with three parameters
    * state or event
    * durative or non-durative (punctual)
    * telic or atelic
      * what is telic or atelic is not really the even, but the description
      * an event can be described as expecting a terminal point or not
* dynamicity vs stativity
  * hard to test dynamicity directly
  * we can test for stativity
  * stative predicates can be used in the present non-progressive without habitual interpretation
    * 'Felipe runs' (non-stative, habitual)
      * 'Felipe is running' (progressive aspect, stative)
      * dynamic predicate
    * 'Felipe knows the answer' (stative)
  * stative predicates are generally incompatible with progressive aspect (in English)
    * '*Felipe is knowing the answer'
* exceptions
  * positional stative predicates
    * 'Jess is standing in the corner' is stative but are required in progressive
  * adjectives in 'being X' construction with a dynamic interpretation 'acting X'
* telicity
  * Test-1: for vs in
  * Telic predicates compatible with 'in X' time, atelic 'for X' time
    * Mary walked to the park in an hour/?for an hour
    * Mary walked to the park for an hour/?in an hour
  * atelic has no expected termination point for the event
  * 'take X time'
    * 'Took me an hour to write this letter' (telic)
    * 'Took me an hour to listen to music' (atelic)
  * telicity is a property of the VP, not the verb
  * choice of object often affects telicity of the VP
    * objects that denote specified quantity or volume makes telic VP
    * objects that denote unspecified quantity or volume makes atelic VP
  * cf
    * maya drew a circle on the blackboard (telic)
    * maya drew circles on the blackboard (atelic)
* Classifications
  * states: +stative +durative -telic
  * activities/processes: -stative +durative -telic
  * accomplishment: -stative +durative +telic
  * achievement: -stative -durative +telic
    * accomplishment and achievement both event predicates with telos
    * difference between 'walked to the park (accomplishment)' and 'reached the summit (achievement)' is achievements are punctual.
  * semelfactives: -stative -durative -telic
    * can describe both single events and repetitions
      * 'the light flashed [for five minutes]'
      * this is called coercion, aktionsart of a predicate can change based on its context of use
  * |State|Stative|Durative|Telic|
    |-----|-------|--------|-----|
    |States|+|+|-|
    |Activities|-|+|-|
    |Accomplishment|-|+|+|
    |Achievement|-|-|+|
    |Semelfactive|-|-|-|
* verbs like 'draw' are incremental theme predicates
  * describe events where objects are progressively affected by the event described by the verb
  * interface between lexical and sentential semantics
