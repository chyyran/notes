# 2021-02-09 Presupposition

* definite article
  * sometimes, odd to use a definite description (DefD, akin to DP in structural grammar)
    * "I will talk about **this** in Friday's lecture"
      * "the lecture that is on friday"
      * odd when there is no lecture on Friday
      * illustrates existence inference of DefD
    * "I will send a message to **the** student in this zoom session
      * odd because there is  more than one student in the zoom sessions
      * uniqueness inference of DefD
    * above sentences **are not false**, they are odd
      * If we negate them, they are still odd
        * "I will not talk about this in Friday's lecture"
  * In general possessive phrases tend to be definite
  * a definite article is not necessary
    * "my student"
    * see if you can paraphrase with a definite article
  * definite descriptions provide description of things
    * presupposes existence of entity
  * salience
    * relevant to the conversation
    * prominent
    * example
      * walking several dog
      * one dog suddenly starts limping
      * 'the dog is hurt' 
        * the hurt dog is salient.
* presuppositions of the definite article?
  * what kinds of inference
  * Fregean presuppositions
    * presuppositions of DefD are conditions that must be satisfied for the DefD to be properly interpreted
  * semantic value of a referential expression like "Jess" or "the student" is the referent
    * "Jess" refers to the person Jess
    * "the student" may refer to the salient person who is a student
  * Fregean analysis of 'the'
    * 'the *NP*' has a semantic value only if there is one and exactly one individual that matches the description *NP* in the context of utterance
      * uniqueness is necessary but not sufficient for 'the *NP*' to have a semantic value.
    * If 'the *NP*' has a semantic value then its semantic value is the unique individual that matches the description *NP* in the context of utterance
* What happens when necessary conditions are not satisfied?
  * 'I will talk about this in **Friday's lecture**'
    * Friday's lecture has no semantic value
    * This sentence has no truth value
  * 'I will send a message to the student in this zoom session'
    * There is no uniqueness for the DefD 'the student'
    * This sentence has no truth value
  * If we have a DefD without truth value in a larger sentence, the larger sentence will also have no truth value.
  * The negated sentences are still odd, because there is no truth value.
  * **Predicts that presupposition survives negation and similar operations**.
* Semantic presuppositions
  * presuppositions of definite descriptions like *the* are encoded in the lexical entry for *the*
  * **def'n** Semantic presupposition
    A sentence *S* presupposes proposition *P* iff *S* is neither true nor false unless *P* is true.
  * "I will talk about this on Friday's lecture"
    * Truth value of this sentence **presupposes** the existence and uniqueness of the lecture on Friday.
* Presupposition and Assertion
  * We can define presuppositions of DefD in pragmatic term as well
    * When a speaker uses a DefD like *the NP*, the speaker **presents as common ground** the existence and uniqueness of *NP* in the context of utterance
  * Pragmatic presuppositions are propositions that the speaker presents as common ground.
  * "Drew stopped smoking"
    * "Drew used to smoke" is presented as common ground
* What is **common ground?**
  * Defined by philosopher Robert Stalnaker
  * "Common or mutual belief, or what a speaker presupposes is what she believes to be common or mutual belief"
  * A proposition *P* is common believe of a group of believers iff all in the group believe *P*, all in the group believe that all believe it, and all believe it that all believe it, ..., recursively.
  * Flat earthers
    * If we all are flat earthers, but keep it a secret, then 'the earth is flat' is not CG
    * If we are all flat earthers, and we all think everyone is flat earthers, and we all think that everyone thinks that everyone is flat earthers, etc... then it is CG.
* Facts vs belief
  * beliefs are propositions that someone believes in, regardless of whether the belief is justified or not
  * it is the base assumptions under which an utterance is evaluated
  * Jess believes that *p*
    * There is no entailment that *p* is not true
    * There is a conversational implicature that infers that the speaker believes *p* is not true
      * Maxim of manner 
* speaker presupposition
  * propositional attitude of the speaker
  * take it for granted, or act if one takes it for granted as background information
* presuppositions are contrasted with assertions
  * assertions are a kind of speech act
  * when a speaker asserts a proposition *P*, she presents *P* o the discourse participants as a true proposition to be added to CG
  * assertions are used to add information to the CG
  * 'There will be a test next Thursday'
    * you may not believe that there is a test next thursday
    * if the prof says the sentence, it is informative
    * the proposition is added to CG
  * presuppositions are propositions that are presented as already being part of CG
  * assertions are propositions that are to be added to the CG
  * 'Drew stopped smoking'
    * Presupposition: 'Drew used to smoke'
    * Assertion: 'Drew does not currently smoke'
  * There is no point in asserting a sentence if its semantic presupposition are not satisfied by CG
    * Sentence asserted by a speaker can not express a true proposition unless its semantic propositions are satisfied
    * A speaker who asserts a sentence with semantic proposition *P* takes for granted that *P*is already part of the CG.
  * 'I will send more information about the midterm test'
    * If the existence and uniqueness of *the midterm test* is not part of the CG, the sentence is odd and has no truth value. 
* presupposition accomodation
  * sometimes speakers assert a reasonable contribution that is not necessarily part of CG
    * A: Why are you so late?
    * B: My car broke down.
      * presupposes B has *unique* a car 
      * asserts that B's car broke down
  * sometimes this doesn't work
    * A: What are you doing tonight
    * B: I'm going to the movies too?
      * Presupposes there is another person going to the movies with B
      * '(unknown to A) X is going to the movies'
    * A: What do you mean? Who's also going to the movies?
* presupposition tests
  * semantic presuppositions are conditions that must be satisfied for a sentence to have a truth value
  * can be difficult to decide whether a sentence is false, or lacks a truth value
  * 'The king of France is bald'
    * Is this false, or lacks a truth value?
    * This sentence has a semantic presupposition that is not satisified
      * 'There is a king of France'
  * 'Hey, wait a minute' test (HWM test)
    * diagnostic of pragmatic presupposition
    * Let S be some asserted sentence by A, implying proposition P
    * Let S' = Hey, wait a minute I didn't know that P
    * If S' is felicitous, then this supports that P is a presupposition of S
    * Conversely, if S' is not felicitous, then this challenges the analysis that S presupposes P.
  * 'The mathematician who proved Goldbach's Conjecture is a woman
    * Hey, wait a minute, I didn't know that **someone proved Golbach's conjecture**
      * supports that A presupposed someone proved Goldbach's conjecture
    * '#Hey, wait a minute, I didn't know she was a woman'
      * supports that A did not presuppose that whoever solved Goldbach's Conjecture was a woman
* Presupposition projection
  * presuppositions survive being embedded in **non-veridical environments**
  * differ from at-issue entailments
  * when you put a clause in a non-veridical environment, at-issue entailments are 'trapped' in the clause
    * not entailments of the whole sentence
  * negation is one such non-veridical environment
    * example
      1. 'Jess likes every fruit'
      2. 'Jess does not like every fruit'
      3. 'Jess likes bananas' 
    * 1 entails 3, 2 does not entail 3
    * If you negate a sentence, you lose its at-issue entailments
  * antecedents of conditional clauses
    * *If Jess stopped smoking*, she may be nervous
  * modal expressions like 'may'
    * *Jess may have stopped smoking*
  * questions:
    * 'Did Jess stop smoking'
  * Operators that allow presuppositions to project are called *presupposition holes*
  * We want to test with as many holes as possible
  * If a presupposition projects from all or most of such environments, we have a good support that a claim is a presupposition.
  * conventional implicatures also tend to project from non-veridical environments
    * CIs are speaker oriented
    * Presuppositions are presented as existing CG
    * in practice this is quite difficult to tell apart
    *
