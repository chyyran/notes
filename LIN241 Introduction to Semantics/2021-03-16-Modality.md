# 2021-03-16 Modality

* modal expressions
  * "must", "can", "may"
  * act similar to determiner quantifiers like "every", "some"
  * a lot of structural regularity across natlangs, and domains
  * possibility, necessary, impossible
* displacement
  * is the ability to talk about situations that are not here or actual
  * displacement in space
    * "thomas is in hamburg"
  * displacement in time
    * 'yesterday was a wednesday'
  * **modal displacement**
    * 'if kangaroos had no tail, they would topple over'
* modals
  * auxillaries
    * might
  * adverbs
    * possibly
  * propositional attitude verbs
    * 'chris **believes** that jess will arrive late'
      * tells us the truth in the possible world that agrees with chris' attitude
    * 'chris **doubts** ...'
    * 'chris **hopes** ...'
  * habitual statements
    * 'jess smokes'
      * jess is likely to smoke
  * generic statements
    * 'bears like honey'
      * bears have a disposition to like honey, not necessarily forall b. BEAR(b) -> LIKE(b, Honey)
* modal force
  * what kind of modality 
  * possibility modals
    * Jess **might** be at home
      * a possibility that Jess is at home (but also possible she is not at home)
  * necessity modals
    * Jess **must** be at home
      * a necessity that Jess is at home (not possible that she is not at home)
* modal flavour
  * the type of possibility we are entertaining
  * epistemic
    * information relative 
    * "as far as we know, Julia might be the murderer"
  * deontic
    * not based on information available to us
    * something that can happen according to the rules/constraints
    * something is possible within some constraints/regulations
    * man-made constraints/social objects
    * "according to these rules, you can opt out of the plan"
  * goal oriented
    * possibility/necessity as a condition to fulfill a goal
    * "if you want to get a good seat, you have to arrive early"
  * dynamic
    * natural consequence, natural evolution
    * "fir trees can grow in this climate"
    * "i have to sneeze"
    * ability 
      * "jess can lift 200 kg"
* to make the modal flavour distinction clearer, they built system to express these differences
  * Julia must be the murderer
  * Julia must go to jail
    * deontic
    * this 'must' is not necesary-- Julia may not necessarily go to jail
* think of sentences of being true or false in a world
  * sentences express propositions in a world
  * "galactus exiled the silver surfer"
    * in a sense, this is true but not literally true in our world
    * "in the marvel universe, galactus exiled the silver surfer"
  * in the possible worlds that conform to the canon of the marvel universe, it is true that ...
* there are many possible worlds
  * "Toronto is in Canada" has { w1, w2, ..., }
  * maybe worlds that don't correspond to reality
* "Jess might be at home"
  * prejacent: "Jess be (is) at home"
  * modal operator: "might"
  * structure: might(Jess is at home)
  * modal operator tells us the proposition expressed by the prejacent is true in certain worlds
    * The proposition that "Jess is at home is true in certain worlds"
    * possibility-epistemic operator
      * at least once world that is compatible with the information we have access to in which Jess is at home
    * the facts we have access to define the set of compatible worlds
* Let w* represent the real world
  * "Jess might be at home" is true iff there exists a world w' compatible with the information the speaker has in w*, such that the proposition "Jess is at home" is true in w'.
  * does not exclude worlds w'' that are compatible with information in w* but "Jess is at home" is false in w''.
  * what does it mean to be compatible?
    * information is a set of propositions
      * Haven't seen Jess at work today
      * Jess sometimes works from home
      * ...
    * all propositions represent sets of world
    * we take the intersection of all propositions
  * necessity means the prejacent is true in all worlds of the intersection
* 'can' as quantifiers by assuming that propositions are true in possible worlds
  * can: 'proposition that X is true' is true in some possibilities
  * must: 'proposition that X is true' is true in all possibilities
* can vs must is existential vs universal quantification
* complications
  * Albert was caught speeding through a school zone
  * consider 'Albert must pay a fine'
    * forall. w' s.t. Ontario HTA is respected in w', the proposition that Albert will pay a fine is true
  * problems:
    * in at least some worlds w', Albert didn't speed through the school zone because he did not violate HTA
    * in the definition of our possible worlds, **everyone follows the Highway Traffic Act**
    * there is a contradiction
    * we need to consider worlds where the law is not respected
      * the law must have been violated "a little bit"
  * 'Albert must pay a fine' means for all valid possibilities, albert pays a fine
    * what possibilities are we talking about?
    * we require that the HTA is respected (otherwise Albert would not be required to pay a fine)
    * we need to create a weaker definition of our worlds
      * Albert behaved as he did, moving forward, the law will be maximally respected
      * we need to relate 2 sets of worlds
        * set of worlds where Albert violated the law
          * some of these worlds, Albert will not pay a fine
        * moving forward, worlds where Albert respects the law
          * **temporality** is important to modality
      * 2 sets A, and B
        * "modal base" A: a proposition m(w*) that describes how Albert behaved in w*
        * "ordering source" B: a proposition o(w*) that describe the HTA as stated in w*
      * we order the worlds in A according to how good they conform to B
        * then we get the best one as `BEST(m(w*), o(w*))`
          * start from the set of worlds where the modal base is true
          * then B is the subset of A where as many propositions from o(w*) as possible is true.
* can use for epistemic modality
  * 'Jess must be at home'
    * For every world w', if w' is in BEST(m(w*), o(w*)) then the proposition that Jess is at home is true in w'
    * m(w*) describes information available to the speaker
    * o(w*) describes the normal course of events in w*
      * ordering source is used to discard possibilities compatible with the modal base
      * exclude crazy possibilities
* modal flavour in deontic comes from ordering source
* model flavour in epistemic comes from modal base

* terminology
  * modal bases/ordering sources: conversational backgrounds
  * conversational backgrounds are used to define or order possible worlds
  * types
    * epistemic: propositions that describe information available to some agent
    * deontic: propositions that describe rules and regulations
    * circumstantial: propositions that describe facts and circumstances related to the modal statement
    * stereotypical: propositions that describe normal course of events
* under the assumption that natlang quantifiers never use empty restrictions
  * a entails b:
    * a: forall w'. if w' in BEST(m(w*), o(w*)) then p true in w'
    * b: exists w'. if w' in BEST(m(w*), o(w*)) and p is true in w'
  * ex:
    * Jess must be home
    * Jess might be home
* Note that BEST is not the 'intersection'
  * Consider \(A: \bigcap m(w*)\) and \(2: \bigcap o(w*)\)
  * \(B = \emptyset != A \cap 2\)
  * we start from A, then obtain the set where **as many as possible** propositions in 2 are respected
* in english, the negatio is equivalent in a modal statement
  * 'Jess is not allowed to leave' <=> 'Jess has to stay'
  * c: !. exists w'. w' in BEST(m(w*), o(w*)) and p true in w'
  * d: forall w'. w' in BEST(m(w*), o(w*)) and !. p true in w'
* translating to predicate
  * add world argument
  * 'Jess is happy' translated as HAPPY(w*, j)
  * w* is an expression that refers to the actual world
  * 'Jess must be happy' -- 'forall. w'. w' in BEST(m(w*), o(w*)) -> HAPPY(w', j)'
* models
  * U = {Jess, Kelly, Marc, ...}
  * W = { w_1, w_2, ...}
  * \[\[Happy\]\]^M = { \<w_1, Jess\>, ...}

* Reportative -si in quecha as ilocutionary modifier
  * Sincerity conditions
    * speaker not committed to the truth of the prejacent proposition
  * evidential component not part of the propositional component of the speech act
    * projects over negation
    * cannot be challenged
    * cannot be embedded
  * illocutionary modifier analysis accounts for this
