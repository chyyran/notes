# 2021-03-16 Modality

* modal expressions
  * "must", "can", "may"
  * act similar to determiner quantifiers like "every", "some"
  * a lot of structural regularity across natlangs, and domains
  * possibility, necessary, impossible
* displacement
  * is the ability to talk about situations that are not here or actual
  * displacement in space
    * "thomas is in hamburg"
  * displacement in time
    * 'yesterday was a wednesday'
  * **modal displacement**
    * 'if kangaroos had no tail, they would topple over'
* modals
  * auxillaries
    * might
  * adverbs
    * possibly
  * propositional attitude verbs
    * 'chris **believes** that jess will arrive late'
      * tells us the truth in the possible world that agrees with chris' attitude
    * 'chris **doubts** ...'
    * 'chris **hopes** ...'
  * habitual statements
    * 'jess smokes'
      * jess is likely to smoke
  * generic statements
    * 'bears like honey'
      * bears have a disposition to like honey, not necessarily forall b. BEAR(b) -> LIKE(b, Honey)
* modal force
  * what kind of modality 
  * possibility modals
    * Jess **might** be at home
      * a possibility that Jess is at home (but also possible she is not at home)
  * necessity modals
    * Jess **must** be at home
      * a necessity that Jess is at home (not possible that she is not at home)
* modal flavour
  * the type of possibility we are entertaining
  * epistemic
    * information relative 
    * "as far as we know, Julia might be the murderer"
  * deontic
    * not based on information available to us
    * something that can happen according to the rules/constraints
    * something is possible within some constraints/regulations
    * man-made constraints/social objects
    * "according to these rules, you can opt out of the plan"
  * goal oriented
    * possibility/necessity as a condition to fulfill a goal
    * "if you want to get a good seat, you have to arrive early"
  * dynamic
    * natural consequence, natural evolution
    * "fir trees can grow in this climate"
    * "i have to sneeze"
    * ability 
      * "jess can lift 200 kg"
* to make the modal flavour distinction clearer, they built system to express these differences
  * Julia must be the murderer
  * Julia must go to jail
    * deontic
    * this 'must' is not necesary-- Julia may not necessarily go to jail
* think of sentences of being true or false in a world
  * sentences express propositions in a world
  * "galactus exiled the silver surfer"
    * in a sense, this is true but not literally true in our world
    * "in the marvel universe, galactus exiled the silver surfer"
  * in the possible worlds that conform to the canon of the marvel universe, it is true that ...
* there are many possible worlds
  * "Toronto is in Canada" has { w1, w2, ..., }
  * maybe worlds that don't correspond to reality
* "Jess might be at home"
  * prejacent: "Jess be (is) at home"
  * modal operator: "might"
  * structure: might(Jess is at home)
  * modal operator tells us the proposition expressed by the prejacent is true in certain worlds
    * The proposition that "Jess is at home is true in certain worlds"
    * possibility-epistemic operator
      * at least once world that is compatible with the information we have access to in which Jess is at home
    * the facts we have access to define the set of compatible worlds
* Let w* represent the real world
  * "Jess might be at home" is true iff there exists a world w' compatible with the information the speaker has in w*, such that the proposition "Jess is at home" is true in w'.
  * does not exclude worlds w'' that are compatible with information in w* but "Jess is at home" is false in w''.
  * what does it mean to be compatible?
    * information is a set of propositions
      * Haven't seen Jess at work today
      * Jess sometimes works from home
      * ...
    * all propositions represent sets of world
    * we take the intersection of all propositions
  * necessity means the prejacent is true in all worlds of the intersection
