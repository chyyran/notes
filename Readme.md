# Notes

These are my notes. They are mostly incomplete and may be inaccurate, and are for my own usage, but they're free to use. Some of these notes are more organized, some of them are more stream-of-conciousness.

## Conventions

- Start KaTeX math typesetting with brackets (`\( \)`)
- Use YAML front matter for tags.
