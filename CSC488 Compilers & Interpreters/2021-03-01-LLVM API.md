# 2021-03-01 LLVM API

* LLVM IR Instructions
  * RISC-like instruction set
  * Only 31 opcodes
  * Most instructions are 3-address form
    * one or two operand, one result
  * Load/store architecture
    * memory accessed via load/store
    * computational instructions operate on registers
  * infinite, and typed virtregs
    * can declare new register any point
    * register mapped with primitive type
    * backend maps virtregs to physical registers
  * Static single assignment
    * each variable assigned exactly once
    * every variable defined before it's used
    * conversion:
      * for each defn, create new version of the target lvalue and replace with new variable
      * for each use, replace original referred variable with versioned variable reaching use point
    * memory/load stores are not affected by ssa
    * llvm::Value is the base class of all LLVM IR elements
      * each instruction is uniquely associated with the value it defines
    * Handling local variables being modified in different branches
      * Use alloca to allocate stack memory space to hold local variables and use memload/stores
      * Use phi instruction that merges different versions of SSA values depending on the branch
        * phi(x, y) returns either x or y **depending on which block was executed**
      * also usable for for loops
        * alloca to allocate mutable stack memory
        * phi instr at the start of the loop
* LLVM Data Representation
  * primitives
    * void: `void`
    * bool: `i1`
    * integrals: `i[N]` where N is 1 ro 2^23-1
    * floats: 
      * `half` 16bits
      * `float`: 32bit
      * `double`: 64bit
    * pointers: `T*`
      * `null` treated as special value
  * constants
  * virtregs
    * named `[%][a-ZA-Z$._][a-ZA-Z$._0-9]*`
    * unnamed: `[%][0-9][0-9]*`
    * registers have function-level scope
      * registers in diff funcs may have same name names
      * registers are SSA
  * variables
    * all addressable objects (lvalues) are explicitly allocated
    * globals:
      * Begin with `@`
      * global scope symbol that points to address of object  
      * always pointer: it is a constant pointer to the global scope
    * locals:
      * `alloca` instruction allocates memory in stackframe
      * dealloc'd when function returns
    * heaps:
      * llvm does not model this, handled by libc
      * `malloc` allocates heap memory
      * `free` frees memory allocated by malloc
  * load/store instr
    * load:
      * `<res> = load <type>* ptr`
      * `<res>` is the target register
      * `<type>` is the type of the data (ptr type)
      * `<ptr>` is the register that has the addr of the data
    * store:
      * `store <type> <value>, <type>* <ptr>`
      * `<type>` is type of data
      * `<value>` is either constant or a register that holds the value
      * `<ptr>` is the reg that has the target address
  * aggregated types
    * array:
      * `[<# of elements> x <type>`]
        * single dimension: `[40 x i32]`, `[4 x i8]`
        * multi dimension: `[3 x [4 x i8]]`, `[12 x [10 x float]]`
    * structs:
      * `type { <list of types> }`
      * `type { i32, i32 }`, `type {i8, type { i32, i8 } }`
    * function:
      * `<rettype> (param types)`
      * `i32 (i32)`
        * normal function type
      * `float (i16, i32*)*`
        * this is a function pointer
* Getelementptr
  * Pointer arithmatic
  * Obtains pointer to an element in an aggregate type
  * `<res> = getelementptr <pty>* <ptrval>{, <t> <idx>}*`
    * `<res>`: target virtreg
    * `<pty>`: reg that **defines aggregate type**
    * `<ptrval>`: reg that points to the data variable
    * `<t>` type of the index
    * `<idx>`: index value
  * Consider
    ```llvm
    %struct.pair = type {i32, i32}
    ...
    %a = alloca %struct.pair
    %first = getelementptr %struct.pair* %a, i32 0, i32 0
    ```
  * First notice that `%a` is of type `%struct.pair* %a`
  * Second argument (`i32 0`) is usually padded by 0
    * This is an additional index since in C, pointers can be used as arrays
    * Second index is used to index into array of a type
  * Third argument is the index of the struct
* integer conversion
  * truncate
    * `<res> = trunc <iN1> <value> to <iN2>` 
      * N1 > N2 is required
  * zero extension
    * `<res> = zext <iN1> <value> to <iN2>`
  * signed extension
    * `<sext> = <iN1> <value> to <iN2>`
* arithmetic
  * add
    * `<res> = add [nuw] [nsw] <iN> <op1>, <op2>`
    * nuw: no unsigned wrap
      * if unsigned overflow occurs, result is poisoned (undefined)
    * nsw: no signed wrap
      * if signed overflow occurs, result is poisoned
* Control Representation
  * basic blocks
  * every basic block ended with one terminator instruction
  * label denotes start of a block
    * label of entry block is `entry`
  * Return: `ret <type> <value> | ret void`
  * Unconditional branch: `br label <dest>`
    * `dest` is a label
  * Conditional branch
    * `<res> = icmp <cmp> <ty> <op1>, <op2>`
      * returns true or false based on comparison of two variables of the same type
      * `cmp` is the comparison option
        * equal: `eq`
        * not equal: `ne`
        * unsigned gt: `ugt`
        * unsigned gte: `uge`
        * unsigned lt: `ult`
        * unsigned lte: `ule`
        * signed gt: `sgt`
        * signed gte: `sge`
        * signed lt: `slt`
        * signed lte: `sle` 
    * `br i1 <cond>, label <thenbb>, label <elsebb>`
      * if `<cond>` is 1, then jumps to `thenbb`, else `elsebb`
  * switch
    * `switch <iN> <value>, label <default> [<iN> <val>, label <dest>]`
  * Phi
    * `<res> = phi <t> [<val_0>, <label_0>], [<val_1>, <label_1>], ...`
    *  returns the value in `<val>` depending on the label that we branched from
 * function call
   * `<res> = call <t> [<fnty>*] <fnptrval>(<fn args>)`
   * `t`: type of the return value
   * `fnty`: signature of the pointer to the function (optional)
   * `fnptrval`: pointer to the target function
   * `fn args`: argument list 
* How to emit IR?
  * option 1: emit raw tex
  * option 2: LLVM framework API
    * builtin syntax and semantic checking
    * recommended way
    * steps:
      * create `llvm::Module`
      * create `llvm::IRBuilder`
      * create global var `llvm::GlobalVariable` for the module
      * create functions `llvm::Function`
      * create entry basic block for the function `llvm::BasicBlock`
      * set insertion point of the builder to `entry` basic block
      * call `CreateX()` methods in `IRBuilder`
      * create additional basic blocks and change insertion points of the builder as needed
