# 2019-10-21 Scheduling

* assume processes run to completion when they are schedule
* goal is to minimize average wait time
* thread/process is blocked during i/o and does not use CPU
  * new
  * ready
  * running -> CPU burst
  * whenever IO is happening, it is not using CPU
  * exit
* goal
  * fairness - avoid starvation
  * enforce policies
  * balance - all parts of the system should be busy
* batch sytems
  * throughput
    * maximze jobs per hour
  * turnaround time
    * submission and completion time diff should be small
  * cpu utilization
    * cpu should be busy all the time
* goal sometimes conflict with each other
  * response time and proportionality
  * rts
    * meet deadlines
    * predictability
* preemptive scheduling
  * allows cpu to steal time from a running process
* FCFS
  * non-premptive
  * first come first serve
  * average waiting time is quite long
  * convoy effect all other processes wait for the one big process to release the CPI
* Shortest job first
  * pre-emptive is shortest remaining time
  * choose the process with shortest expected processing time
    * programmer estimate
    * statistics
    * shortest next CPU burst
  * provably optimat wrt average wait time
* Round robin
  * time sharing systems
  * each thread is in a queue, and you cycle throughqueue
  * choice of quantum (timeslice is crucial)
    * \(q \to \infty\), RR turns into FCFS
    * \(q \to 0\), overhead of switching overwhelms useful time
    * want \(q\) to be quire large wrt context switch time.
    * whatever comes first gets to go before something ends when 2 things end/start at the same time
