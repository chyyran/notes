#### interpretations
1. Rickshaw Boy is part of Lao She's Larger's Project
   * Depicting Beijing
   * lots of different classes
     * scholars, rickshaw pullers, prostitutes
   * walking city
   * slums, rich areas
   * not shy to name streets
   * Rickshaw pulling not a very glorious job but was something people would have gone for
   * "a rickshaw puller would have problems other than finding food. He must have aspirations, sexual desires, family, and children." --Lao She
   * wanted to find out lives of Rickshaw pullers
2. Rickshaw as a symbol of China's modernization
   * hierarchy
     * motorcars, rickshaws
     * female rickshaw pullers
   * rickshaw as an **emblem** of class stratification 
     * inequality in the city
   * rickshaw is a human horse
     * class issue
     * issue of ability
     * humans as beasts of burden
     * can see this in the story (With his long things, he took great strides, ... 8-9)
     * oneness of the rickshaw (person as the cart, easy to remember, 15)
     * "Huniu held her tongue [...] this big creature who could buck and kick if pushed too far (192-3)"
3. Bankruptcy of individualism
   * Fault of the protagonist
   * Xiangzi's own choices that caused his downfall 
   * Individualism is "not correct", should be the collective
   * "Through no fault his own, he had lost his rickshaw, ... However badly he wanted to outshine others, he was doomed to fail (74)"
   * Physical, moral decline
   * In the end society is not any better
   * Ends up doing whatever it takes to survive, completely changed
   * Failure of individualism in society
4. Problem of Slavery & Freedom
   * Misrecognition of the symbol of slavery for the promise of liberation
   * The rickshaw, procession **does not bring him freedom**
   * "free to choose his own shackles"
   * his dream is to be bound to the rickshaw
   * the rickshaw is a form of economic oppression, he is obsessed with the idea of the rickshaw
   * his body is being traded for capital via the rickshaw
   * examples
     * The reason he lost his rickshaw was because he wanted to bring the passenger out the city for money
     * When he finally gets back to the city, he wants to kiss the floor (city as a metropole, symbol of capitalism)
       * loves the city as a source of capital
     * Disregards other rickshaw pullers
     * Liu Siye/Fourth Master is also the same, only cares about money and not Xiangzi as a person
     * relationship between Huniu and Xiangzi
       * seduces Xiangzi
       * spends money recklessly, power of consumerism
       * economic oppression, controls Xiangzi's finances
       * psychological pride
       * lets go of her body, eventually dies from overeating
### Why is this work a "classic"?
* Ah Q and Xiangzi
  * don't really have a great ending
  * both protagonists aren't really aware of the societal movements around them
  * omniscient narrator who knows about some more of the societal movements
  * lower economic class
  * poverty, stupidity
  * maybe the protagonist is responsible due to limited vision of personal glory
    * society may have allowed the fall 
    * Xiangzi does not just represent his low economic class, but represents anyone who follows the individualist mindset
    * AhQ has a sense of false pride, but was not necessarily indivudalistic
### New Realist Fiction
* Appeared in the late 80s to contemporary works
* Center around insignificant persons, later on became more apolitical
