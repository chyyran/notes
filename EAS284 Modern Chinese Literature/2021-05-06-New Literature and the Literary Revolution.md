## Relationship between Tradition and Modernity
* Complicated relationship
* Tradition is **invented**
  * Nothing is a tradition until we say it is
* Imperialist desires in China to maintain the status quo in the late Qing 
  * Calling to be strong as a nation
* Iconoclastic attitudes towards Classic texts
  * need to "break" from "Classical literature"
* Tradition **shapes** the values of "Chinese modernity"
  * China was looking towards the Western discourse as "modern"
  * Tradition used and named as something separate to compare with "modernity"
  * Need a "base" of tradition to "break away" before one can imagine a "Chinese modernity"
  * Despite the desire to separate tradition from modernity
* Literature was not divided from politics in the past
  * Past dynasties still wrote literature to affect change through writing
  * **Function stays the same between traditional and modern literature**
  * Writing and culture was related to politics
* Not just as simple between the difference between vernacular and classical language
