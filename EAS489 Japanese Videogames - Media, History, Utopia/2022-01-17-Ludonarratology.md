* Juul
  * Which perspective do we understand or talk about games?
  * Games as a set of rules vs games as narrative?
  * both real and fictional at the same time
    * fictional narrative real rules
  * juul focuses a lot in the ludologic perspective
  * humans are narrative beings
  * rules govern narratives and vice versa
  * imagined rules... meaning making from rules?
* what is intermedia?
  * compared to other forms of narrative
  * experience as creators vs consumers
  * consalvo's contextuality, not detached from contexts of other media and media ecosystems
  * localization, remediation of games from a production standpoint
  * text vs social context of games
  * different levels on which remediation operates
  * relationship to hardware
    * not purely about games
    * cinema
    * television
* how we think about narrative
  * narratives are continuously created on all layers
  * narratives about following a team throughout a season, throughout whats happening in a match
  * some games dont have a 'progression'-based narrative
  * experience of playing inevitably generates an narrative that continues because of play
    * emergent gameplay, emergent narrative
  * how you encounter other players
    * create a story 
  * emergent narrative moments
  * narratives that happen outside of diegesis
    * paratexts
    * social discussions, online discussion boards
      * tlou2 lol
* harvest moon
* job simulator
  * could create a narrative
* genette's story time vs discourse time
  * time in games
  * open world games
  * engagement with media narrative implications
  * how can we start thinking of our understanding of time outside of the specific context of a game
    * global capitalism
    * sociopolitical climate
    * cues from games to think about time at a philosophical level to disrupt established understanding of how time operates
* emergent gameplay
  * paratextual interactions
  * EVE online
    * gameplay is spreadsheet simulator
    * lore is very deep, however
      * narrative is entirely player driven
      * premeditated narrative is set aside
    * documenting eve online as if it were events that happen
    * what is reality? vs in game
    * how do we experience reality?
    * purposely create boundaries between virtual space and real space
* role play and hardware
  * idea of what character is doing in game
  * play session as narrative instance?
  * vr immersion
  * interaction with the text?
  * seeing the world through characters eyes
    * physical but what about the metaphysical (mind)?
  * unifying the narrative of reading with the diegesis
  * put a game down and get back to it
    * how does time elapse
* time continues while you're not engaging in online games
  * what is the question of canon in relationship to player-controlled time
  * does canon matter, if so why?
  * can text be flexible?
  * inputs can be different per play instance
  * not recorded
  * every single time you interact with it is different
* what is part of the canon of the franchise
  * franchise is paratext
  * how does that fit into canon
* everything is generated as you play through it
  * suspense, virtualities, potentialities
  * reification of virtualities
  * very specifically your own narrative 
    * illusion of a possibility
    * pessimistic understanding of possibilities
    * virtualities on multiple levels in games
  * improv? theatre that takes into consideration the audience participation
* concept of canon
* games and philosophy
  * stanley parable
  * undertale
  * told to do something but you dont have to do it at all
  * player and the game (narrator) and character
    * you are not stanley!
  * talos principle
    * instructions from god figure
    * have literal dialogue with
    * interesting 'you' (samuel)
  * games can't be experienced passively
  * most people will end up taking similar decisions
  * decisions in game
* actualization via playing of game
  * viewer is inescapably participating with the experience of the painting
  * eye is tracking details in film which will change the experience
  * conditions for engagement is inescapable when consuming media
  * how we interact with the world (i.e. media) via sensory input
  * what is the role of games?
    * analytical, purely mental action of decision
* what is passive?
  * not being produced as you watch it
* frustration in LP (kelly)
  * 'you're reading it wrong'
  * 'right and wrong ways to play'
  * this happens!
  * open endedness has a limit
  * does the content creator matter? what is the intension of the author in the text
  * texts are not authored in a vaccum 
    * games in particular are being made as gamers are playing it
    * back and forth dialogue between author and reader
  * also true for games that are not online games
  * roguelike, replaying
* game developer releasing half finished games, capitalism rather than game design
  * how we perceive time differently in video games
  * wasting time in videogames is rarely a fail condition
    * open world, day night cycles
    * witcher 3 play gwent all day, go for hike
    * come here in the morning at 7am, but can go there at 7am
    * closer a game tries to mimic reality, the more we have to engage in the mental reconceptualzation of story time and discourse time because of game mechanics
    * length of a day in game vs length of day in real life
      * often condensed
      * eg star citizen, also condensed day night cycle
      * physics are happening in realtime but planet time is localized physically
        * chronotope
      * doesn't matter which day
  * advent of games that asked you to follow schedules
  * shenmue; i.e. have to take the bus at a specific time
* the longing
  * discourse occurs in realtime, need to take the year to finish the story
* things that you don't see
  * but possibilities
  * not true only for games
  * imagined possibility that it doesn't happen
  * possibility is only squashed when they do it
  * videogames vs conventional media
  * similarity of possibilities that can occur
  * replaying of a game operates on a different level
  * accumulated knowledge that you have
    * Nier automata
    * outer wilds
  * game time
  * replaying
  * knowledge in games
  * recontextualization in narrative
  * knowledge accumulated is the only thing that you keep with you
    * skill
    * narrative
