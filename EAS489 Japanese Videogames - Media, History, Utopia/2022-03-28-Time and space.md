* Utopian thinking links time and space
* way in which human culture interprets itself and human existence
* imagined worlds are linked to utopian thinking
* utopia functions in ambiguous doubl emeaning
  * place to be desired
  * place that does not exist
* roots in space it wants to break from
* virtual worlds
* language is a technology
  * nothing intrinsically dehumanizing in virtual relations
  * mediation does not factor
* virtual: ontologically separate
  * plurality of constructed space
* how do we subvert conventional notions of a game?
  * our own conventional assumptions about games?
  * how do we start thinking about games differently from space
  * what does a utopia project look like
* virtual connect to fantasy?
  * NNK is a space for dreams
  * way to deal with trauma
