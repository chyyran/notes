# 2022-02-14 Space beyond the nation state

* An American Utopia
  * Weaves utopian speculation and concrete political theory
  * not many utopian works of fiction in the late 2010s, YA fiction
  * idea of utopia gone in fiction, why?
    * is utopia incompatible with information technology?
      * Has the internet absorbed our desire for utopia?
    * Thatcherism/Reaganism
      * Delegitimizing language opposing neoliberal idealogy 
    * Utopia as communism has failed with the dissolution of the USSR
  * People don't have the idea of a non-capitalistic society
  * political left has lost idea of revolution
  * Utopia of dual power
    * entity outside of government would take care of civic services 
      * food/medical/etc.
      * replace but don't directly oppose the government
      * Unions used to serve this role
        * doesn't work anymore because they are no longer as powerful, anti unionism in US
      * doctors/lawyers can be utopian but also have connections to capital
      * justice system is too close to the state
      * post office as this entity
        * postal worker can walk in the community and interact with their service area
        * census, pension, stamps = currency
        * obsoleted with the internet
      * the military as the utopian organization
        * easiest way to get healthcare in US is to conscript everyone for army healthcare (?)
        * army exists outside of the revolution suppressing army
        * army can stand against the state because it has its own institutions
        * by including everyone, the army becomes unable to fulfill its function as the arm of violence
        * because the army is unable to fulfil monopoly of violence, so thus the nation becomes unrecognizable
* Death Stranding
  * Replaying Japan
  * Pandemic, much higher need for deliveries in Covid 19
  * prominence of a deliveryman in a postapocalyptic context
  * utopian possibilities that emerge from the role of deliveryman
  * primarily based on aiding other players
    * not opposing or killing someone, i.e. dark souls
    * rules of what you could do are limiting you to aiding others
    * could potentially grieef by cluttering an area, but things degrade and go away
    * idea of strands is how you connect with others indirectly
    * set in america, some american context
    * not really the incapacity of thinking beyond the nation state
    * change is not change anymore once implemented,  you need to start over.
  * dystopian setting is highlighting problems endemic to the present and makes those problems much more obvious
  * utopia is the negation of the present
  * once you reach the state of the negation of something then you need to negate that
