## Ditransitives
* give "I give you a book"
* bought "I bought a flower for him"
* where does the second object in the dative shift get case?
  * double object construction   
* what structural relations must hold between the two args?
* are the two structures derived from one another
## Bars and Lasnik
* Squib on anaphoric relations in double-object
  * I showed John himself (in the mirror)
  * \*I showed himself John (in the mirror)
  * I gave no one anything
  * \*I gave anyone nothing
* John must c-command himself
  * With mutual c-command, the asymmetry is not explained
* NPIs must be c-commanded by a negative item like negation
  * I gave anyone nothing
  * \*I gave no one anything
    * \*I gave anything to no one
### Larsson vs Jackendoff
* VP shells
* early transition into X-bar
* vberb and indirect object make a constituent that excludes thje direct object
* underlying is John [a letter [send to Mary]] -> John send [a letter [t to Mary]]
* direct analogy between passives and double object
* main debate: can we explain double-object with structure alone or do we need to care about linear order
