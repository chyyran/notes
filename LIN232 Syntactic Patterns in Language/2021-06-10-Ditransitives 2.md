## Larsson argument demotion
* Subject of the active version is demoted to adjunct PP'
* Object gets promoted to subject
* theta role assigned as a subject
* We have to say preposition is pure case marking
  * 'to' is not an independent case licensor but is a marker of case by itself
* passives have optional adjunct but not in dative construction
* V' is reanalyzed to V, and complement NP moves to V' adjunct position
  * V licenses accusative case to adjunct NP
  * how do we assign case twice?
* all verbs assign 2 cases
  * structural and inherent case
* Larsson's analysis means that we have to move V to v_active to assign structural objective case in [T [VP V ...]]
  * explains why passives can't assign ACC for complement because it can't move to head,vP
## jackendoff
* I talked [to my sister] [about parents]
* I talked [about parents] [to my sister]
* for jackendoff this meant that there must have been a linear order
* jackendoff believed that modifyign the definition of binding domain was easier
