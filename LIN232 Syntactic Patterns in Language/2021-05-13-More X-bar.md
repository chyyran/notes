  * N' -> AP N'
  * N' -> N' PP
  * N' -> N (PP)
* Prepositional
  * PP -> P'
  * P' -> {AdvP / PQual} P'
    * No specifier
  * P' -> P (NP)

  * A' -> A {(PP) / (CP)}
* Verbal
  * VP -> V'
  * V' -> V' PP
  * V' -> V' NP
  * V' -> V' NP
  * V' -> V' AdvP
  * V' -> AdvP V'
  * V' -> V {(NP) (PP) (NP) (NP) (PP) (CP) (AP)}
* Complementival
  * CP -> C'
  * C' -> C TP
* Tensal
  * TP -> {NP CP} T'
  * T' -> T VP
* Determinival
  * DP -> D'
  * D' -> D NP
* Conjunctival
  * \(\alpha\) -> \(\alpha\) conj \(\alpha\) where \(\alpha\) is any X, X', or XP. 

## X-bar and NP

* There is an NP version of the do-so test
* 'One replacement'
  * "That packet of tomato seeds with a yellow label from my neighbour"
    1. The *one* with a yellow label from my neighbour
       * one = packet of tomato seeds 
    2. The *one* from my neighbour
       * one = package of tomato seeds with a yellow label 
    3. *the one of tomato seeds with a yellow label from my neighbour
       * one = packet
       * This means that there are different types of PPs that we can use to attach to nouns
* Allows us to diagnose complements in X-bar
* Consider the tree for the above example
  * 
    ```
    [.NP [.D That] 
        [.N' 
            [.N' 
                [.N' 
                    [.N packet]
                    [.PP [.P' 
                        [.P of]
                        [.NP 
                            [.N' 
                                [.NP [.N'
                                    [.N tomato]]]
                                [.N' [.N seeds]]]]]]]
            [.PP [.P'
                [.P from]
                [.NP
                    [.D my]
                    [.N' [.N neighbour]]]]]]]]
    ```  
  * notice that since *seeds* is the head it does not need to be directly below an NP
* One-replacement targets bar levels without reaching into phrases
## Parts of an X-bar
* A complement of a phrase XP is a sister of X where X is a head
* An adjunct of a phrase X' is a sister and daughter of X'
* A specifier is the daughter of an XP (and sister to X')
* If you can repeat it, it is most likely a complement or an adjunct

## Parameters
* The position of specifiers, adjuncts, and complements are different in languages and can be represented by rules
* Mongolian
  * Specifier: XP -> (YP) X'
  * Adjunct: X' -> (ZP) X'
  * Complement: X' -> (ZP) X
* English
  * Specifier: XP -> (YP) X' 
  * Adjunct: X' -> (ZP) X' / X' -> X' (ZP)
    * both directions work (I swam quickly vs I quickly swam)
  * Complement: X' -> X (ZP)
    * opposite of mongolian
    * appears after the head
* Principles and parameters 
  * binary switches that would 'configure' the language organ 
  * set by language input
  * baby would get enough input to configure the positioning of specifiers/adjuncts/complements
  * no longer really accepted
    * Discourse configurational language
      * can put things in any order depending on importance
      * P&P wouldn't really make sense
  * consistent rules in a language such as head-complement order is still called a 'parameter'

## DP theory

* Determiners act weirdly in our current conceptualization of X-bar 
* We just stick them in NPs by themselves
* In English, there can only be one D per NP in English
  * *the that book
  * this behaviour is head-like
* Head-like behaviour contradicts our theory on heads and phrases since they appear in specifier position
* DP-hypothesis
  * 'feels right' to say that the NP is the thing in the tree BUT!
  * `[.DP [.D' [.D ] [.NP [.N' [.N ]]]]]`
  * There is good evidence for this structure
  * Even in languages where 'the that book' is acceptable the categories differ
    * Mandarin 这両本書 the category of 这 and 本 differ
* English evidence
  * Genitive case
    * Two waysof expressing possession
      * free genitive ('of'-genitive)
        * the armies of Cao Cao
        * the strings of the cello
        * the joy of my friends
      * Saxon genitive ('s-genitive)
        * Cao Cao's armies
        * the cello's strings
        * my friend's glow
    * Saxon genitive is not a suffix to a word, but it appears after an entire phrase
      * [my friend]'s joy
      * [the old tree in my backyard]'s leaves
        * tree is the posessor of the leaves
      * also in complementary distribution with other determienrs
        * *the cello's the strings
        * *my friend's some joy
* In DP schema, where do we put posessors?
  * nominals go in the **specifier** of a DP
  * specifiers go as the adjunct
* What do we do with bare nominals?
  * Cats love to nap
  * She loves skating
  * Ivan gave me a gift
  * We can coordinate the DP to see the category of the phrase
    * ex.
      * assume anything with determiner is a DP
      * if we can coordinate bare nominals with a DP, we know it is a DP
      * Cats and [.DP all tired students] love to nap
      * She love skating and [.DP other winter sports]
      * Ivan and [.DP his friends] gave me a gift
    * bare nominals are likely DPs, and we represent them with a null D head.
    * for expediency, NPs in trees for bare nominals are acceptable
* TPs and empty T should always be drawn
* also C heads

## Pronoun category
* all pronouns are determiners from distribution in English

## Genitive case and features
* Is the posessor + 's a constituent in a DP like *The linguist's desk*?
  * [ linguist's ] can't be separated easily 
* Some determiners are compatible with posessors in English
  * Bolod's [.D every] thought was brilliant
  * Her [.D every] dream came true
* We allow marking case as a feature in DP
* Case is something that nominals can bear, assigned to them based on structural poisition
* In this case, we mark D every in adjunct position to the DP with genitive case
* A "feature" is a tag that a head can host which allows it to select things in the same phrase
* Features also allow us to handle tense by putting [+-past] in tense head
  * She fed my friend's gat
