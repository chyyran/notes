# 2021-09-23 Productivity and Blocking

* What is productivity?
  * When a morphological rule or pattern can be applied to new bases such that new words can be formed, it is said to be **productive**.
  * Wug test!
  * Examples in English
    * *-th*: A -> N "The state of being X"
      * *width* The state of being wide
    * *-ity*: A -> N "The state of being X"
      * *neutrality* The state of being neutral
    * *-ness*: A -> N "The state of being X"
      * *happiness* The state of being happy
* Why is productivity important?
  * Why are suffixes like *-ith* so fossilized compared to *-ity*
  * Productivity is at the heart of word formation
  * Speakers have judgments about possible and impossible words reducing to knowledge of productivity
    * \*helplessful
  * Morphological **competence** must include knowledge of productivity
  * Morphemes can be picky about the base (selectional requirements) and this might be related
* How do we measure productivity?
  * Determined by studying the extent to which an affix to the set of bases in its **domain**
  * > *def'n* **domain**
    > the set of bases that should in principle satisfy subcategorization needs of the affix (i.e. appropriate category)
  * This approach closely relates productivity with an affix's **selectional restrictions** 
    * *-en* vs *-ness*
      * *-en* can only attach to a monosyllabic base (*redden*, *sadden*, *\*happyen*)
  * Haspelmath and Sims (118) note disagreement about whether reducing productivity to lexical resrictions is right
    * If an affix can routinely be used to create affixes that satisfy restrictions then it should be considered productive
    * Others argue that the domain should be disregarded. An affix with a restricted domain can not be productive because it can not contribute a large number of words
    * Affixex for which it is not easy to identify restrictions but are not highly productive, e.g. *-let*
  * Measuring productivity is hard
    * Obvious thing to do is to count attested words
    * Counting does not tell us about word forms!
    * Measuring size of domain isn't straight forward
      * *-esque* attaches to names, how do we count that?
    * Count token frequency in a corpus
      * More productive affixes tend to create words with lower token frequency than less productive affixes
* What determines productivity?
  * Three main factors
    * Transparency
      * What extent is the meaning and form is the affix transparent?
      * Lack of transparency correlates with increased **lexicalization** where a complex form is reanalyzed as a single morpheme
      * Lack of productivity correlates with lack of transparency
    * Usefulness
      * if the affix doesn't add or change a meaning to a word it won't be useful
    * Frequency of the base
      * if possible bases are themselves not frequent then the affix won't be as frequent
  * Three types of selectional restriction
    * categorial restriction
    * phonological restriction
    * semantic restriction (meaning of the base)
* What is the difference between productivity and creativity?
  * Productivity: speakers produce/understand words without noticing they have done so
  * Creativity: speakers consciously use unproductive processes to form new words to be humorous or to draw attention
* What is blocking and how does it relate to productivity
  * Where an affix does not attach because there is an existing word in the language that has the same meaning as the potential word
  * Involves memory strength of the blocking form
