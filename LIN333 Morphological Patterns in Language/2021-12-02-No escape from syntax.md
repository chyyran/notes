# 2021-12-02 No escape from syntax

* What is a morpheme?
  * Returning to the question
  * We originally said a morpheme is an association of form with meaning
  * non-concatenative morphology challenges this notion!
    * prosodic morphology, where the meaning isn't associated with a form at all
    * in reduplication there's no storing of a form, but is stored as segment structure
  * inflection results in inconsistent form-meaning distinctions
  * we need a broad definition of both form and meaning
  * how about elsewhere forms? what is the lexical content of elsewhere?
* Marantz 1997
  * In traditional generative architecture, we feed stuff from the lexicon to syntax
    * syntax is the computaitonal system that maps assigns form and meaning
    * syntax manipulates elements (complex words) fed into it from the lexicon
    * `Syntax = [LexicalItem] -> (Form, Meaning)`
  * the lexicon itself (in the lexicalist hypothesis) has its own system of mapping form and meaning
    * `Lexicon = [Morpheme] -> LexicalItem (Form, Meaning)`
  * lexicon is where idiosyncratic things are listed
    * unpredictable/"unruly" composition (lexicon)
    * predictable/"ruly" composition (syntax)
* Distributive morphology
  * The traditional lexicon disappears 
  * Form-meaning associations are not paired anywhere in the lexicon
  * The job of listing atomic elements is distributed among 3 "lists"
    1. Narrow lexicon 
       * Feeds into syntax 
       * most like the traditional lexicon
       * provides the units that syntax manipulates
       * generative (sets/bundling of features are freely formed, subject to principles in UG)
       * contains atomic **roots** and bundles of **grammatical features** (like morphemes)
       * determined by UG and possibly language-specific constraints
    2. Vocabulary
       * Feeds into phonology 
       * provides exponents for the terminal nodes in syntax
       * roots as well as bundles of grammtical features
       * **compete for insertion into syntax**
       * corresponds to vocabulary lists in wks. 10-11
       * non-generative but expandable
         * learn it from environment, and store it.
    3. Encyclopedia 
       * Feeds into semantic interface 
       * lists special meaning of particular rules, relative to syntactic context of roots, within local domains
       * idioms
       * non-generative but expandable
  * whether you get a zero-level category (word-like) or phrasal category depends on what you're combining
  * grammar constructs all words via merge/move
  * Syntax feeds phonology and LF
* Special sound/meaning/structure correspondence don't coincide in the word
  * lexicalism claims special status for word-size units
  * Marantz rejects word-size units are special in such respect
  * special sound
    * units of various size play a role in phonology 
      * prosody involves morae and syllable as large as phrases
      * always necessary to construct a prosodic structure at every level from word to phrase
      * phonologists have never claimed that a phonological word corresponds to an atom of syntax
    * lexical (MS) vs post-lexical phonology (ATB)
      * does not neatly distinguish lexical items from larger structure
      * MS rules targeting elements larger than words
      * ATB rules targeting elements smaller than words
      * even if you argue this, this could still capture without assuming lexicon (i.e. post syntactic)
  * special meaning
    * lexicalist idea: lexicon provides sound/meaning correspondences for word-size
      * syntax does for larger meanings
      * words can have special meanings that roots may have
        * word formation in lexicon
      * syntactic structures must have predictable meaning from parts
    * special meaning of phrasal idioms are no different than special meanings of words
      * take a leap/take a leak/take a piss
    * common proposal in lexicalist is that such idioms are stored in lexicon
    * not true that special meanings can go everywhere
      * there is a boundary for domain of special meaning
        * subject is introduced low in the VP.
      * no idioms with fixed agents
        * root in agent position, context for special meaning within VP
      * no eventive-passive idioms, but possible non-eventive stative idioms
      * no idioms with causative morphemes and ower agentive verbs, with possible idioms with causative and non-agentive verbs
    * idioms can't include fixed agentive pieces
      * root material in agent phrase would have to be getting a special meaning (from Encyclopedia) int he context of some structure below boundary
      * eg. "The shit hit the fan", where "the shit" is non-agentive and introduced low in the vp
    * 'adjectival' (stative) passives are created with a functional head merging below the head that projects agents
    * eventive (agentive) passives are "formed with a functional head merging above (or as) the head which projects agents."
  * structure can not have special meaning assigned to it
    * structure has to be interpreted in a systematic way
    * 'kicked the bucket' does not have exactly the same meaning of 'die'
      * it does not have the same aspectual meaning
      * '\*he was kicking the bucket for three weeks'
      * transitive structure with definite object has an expected event structure
    * no one has even tried to argue that words have special structure or meaning in some sense phrasal idioms don't
    * neither phrasal idioms have special structure
* intuition that words are special?
  * mistaking the role of roots with words
  * things with special meanings are roots
  * generally one root per word (sometimes more)
  * functional categories that attach to roots in words include boundaries that separate domains of special meanings
  * words are often thus mistaken for islands of special meaning
