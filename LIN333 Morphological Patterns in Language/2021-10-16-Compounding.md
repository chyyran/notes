# 2021-10-16 Compounding

* Compounding is another form of derivation
  * Compound is a word with more than one root
* Derives hierachical, binary branching structures
* Compounding is recursive in many langauages
* In english, category of a node created by compounding receives same syntactic category as the RH constituent. 
  * This is the RHHR
  * Expressed \([X Y]_Y, Y = N, A, V\)
* head rule is parameterized, either right or left handed.
* head rule also holds for gender features on N as well as meaning
  * het  soep-vlees 
    det.sg.neut soup-meat(neut)
    "The soup meat" (Kind of meat, not a kind of soup)
  * de vlees-soep
    det.sg.non-neut meat-soup(non-neut)
    "The meat soup" (Kind of soup, not a kind of meat)
  * notice that when RH is neuter, whole compound is too. When RH is non-neuter, so is whole compound.
* Endocentric vs. exocentric meaning
  * Exocentricity
    * In some cases there is no apparent head
    * Meaning of the whole is not predictable from meaning of the constituents
    * Non-compostional compounds are **exocentric**
    * example
      * porta-lettere "lit. carry letters, postman"
  * Endocentric compounds have internal heads
* Attributive compounds
  * non-head stands in some kind of attributive relation with head
  * example
    * alligator shoes
    * apple pie
    * light house 
* Bahuvrihi-compounds
  * Special type of exocentric compounds where the meaning of the whole denotes the individual entity who is in the posession of the property/quality expressed
  * example
    * four-eyes (someone with glasses)
    * blue-stocking (aristocrat)
* Copulative (appositive) compounds
  * Special type of exocentric compound where there is no semantic head and the parts of the compound are in coordination relation
  * example
    * blue-green, washer-dryer
* Phrasal compounds
  * example
    * [NP. wages or employment] protection
    * [S. one size fits all] mass production public service
* Neoclassical compounds
  * One or more of the pieces involves roots borrowed from Latin or Greek that do not correspond to independent lexemes
  * example
    * biology, psychology, sociology
    * telecamera, telegraph, telegram
    * bureaucrat,  magnetometry, magnetohydrodynamic
* Synthetic compounds
  * Compounds where the non-head is interpreted as an argument of the head which is a deverbal noun.
  * example
    * heartbreaker breaks a heart, and breaker is a deverbal noun
    * swordswallower
  * interpretation of the non-head as argument of the head raises some questions
    * we posit here that the argument structure of the V base is inherited by the derived noun via the suffix (*-er*)
* Noun-incorporation
  * arguable a syntactic process
  * object of the verb is a free form
  * crosslinguistically incorporated objects must be non-specific, nonreferential
  * usually lack inflection like number of case marking
  * example (Ponapean)
    * I kanga-la wini-o
      I eat-COMP medicine that
      "I  took all that medicine" [can not be any medicine left]
    * I keng-winih-la
      I eat-medicine-COMP
      "I completed my medicine-taking" [may be medicine left]
