# 2021-09-23 Decomposition

* What is decomposition?
  * Do what extent do speakers break down complex forms?
  * How do speakers realize a word is morphologically complex?
  * For example we have
    * *success-ful* is relatively transparent and compositional
    * *success-or* is relatively **opaque** and non-compositional
    * We are interested in the *psycholinguistic* aspect of this noncompositional meaning and not the *etymological* aspect
      * The obsolete "coming after" word sense of *success* is how such affixed meanings were ascribed but no longer for a speaker coming into the language at a point of time after such meaning was obsoleted.
  * Processing restrictions
    * All simply words, but many complex word are stored in the lexicon 
    * Some complex words are decomposed and only their component morphemes are tored
    * The difference between decomposed and non-decomposed forms affects memory strength. 
    * Memory is strengthened by accessing the form in the lexicon.
      * If a form mostly or only ever occurs as part of a stored word, it will have poor memory strength
      * Inhibit speaker capacity to **decompose** complex words containing the form
      * **Less likely to be decomposed**
  * Frequency
    * An important factor in determining decomposition probability is frequency
    * A complex form that is less frequent than base then it is likely to be decomposed
      * *modernity* is less frequent than *modern* so it is likely decomposed as *modern-ity*
    * A complex form more frequent than base is likely to be stored whole
      * *security* is more frequent than *secure* so they are likely to be stored whole.
    * We can ask about *parsing ratio* for particular affixes
      * Lower parsing ratio correlates with lower productivity
      * How often a complex form is stored vs decomposed
* Lexical decision tasks
  * Participants judge the lexical status of a string presented as the target form
  * What is measured is the correctness of the lexical decision and the response time
    * Response time is interpreted as proxy for how long it takes to access a form in the lexicon
    * Sometimes we can measure correctness of decision
    * Dependent variable is response time here
  * Prime can facilitate a lexical decision
    * Psycholinguists use priming effects to probe relatedness between lexical elements
    * Priming effects can be obtained even if participant is unaware they have been primed
      * **Masked priming effect** where the prime is presented so quickly so that the participant does not consciously process the prime.
      * Eliminates certain confounds and may enable a window into early processing
* Form vs meaning
  * Lexical processing occurs in two stages
  * Form based (orthographic) decomposition occurs early during visual word recognition
  * Semantic interpretation of the decomposed constituents at a later stage
  * When we process a morphologically complex form we are not simultaneously processing form and meaning
  * We have to differentiate between morphological decomposition (form) vs semantic decomposition
  * Evidence for this comes from priming experience
    * Primes are UNCOVER or RECOVER
      * both are morphologically well structured and decomposable
    * target is COVER
    * both primes facilitate the recognition of the target comparably, regardless of whether they share both meaning and form, or form with little meaning
      * UNCOVER and COVER are clearly semantically related
      * RECOVER and COVER are not as clearly related 
    * This tells us that semantic interpretation is coming after because both words prime equally as well
    * This also predicts no difference between truly morphological related primes vs unrelated primes
      * CORN-CORNER, BROTH-BROTHEL found no difference between these and morphologically related prime-target pairs (some conflicting results)
    * It seems form is purely linear and strings are being eagerly decomposed
* Neighbourhood density
  * measure of similarity of forms
  * neighbours are formed by changing one letter
  * number of neighbours a form has can influence priming
  * the bigger the neighbourhood the slower the response times
  * effects of neighbourhood density may explain discrepancies between processing finds across languagess
  * languages differ across how morphologically rich they are
  * highly analytic languages have less neighbours
