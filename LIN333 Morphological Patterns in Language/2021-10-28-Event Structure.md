# 2021-10-28 Event Structure

* While there is a great variety of verb meanings, they can be categorized into a finite, small number of *event types*
* Aristotle observed that events come in two varieties
  * Those that proceed in the same way as their beginning to arbitrary stopping point
    * If you take any slice of the event the same event is happening
    * i.e. *walking*
  * Those that progress towards some culmination or endpoint after which is over
    * i.e. *closing*
* This is what we call **event structure**
* Event types
  * Vendler's 4-way distinction
  * Types
    * States
      * e.g. *have*, *know*
      * have no internal temporal structure
      * no change implicated or entailed over the span of time which the state holds
    * Activities
      * e.g. *run*, *scribble*
      * ongoing *events* that involve a process with **duration** but **no necessary endpoint**
      * internal changes that have homogenous sub-parts
    * Accomplishments
      * e.g. *close*, *melt*
      * events that have a process portion that proceeds towards a **logically necessary endpoint**
      * have duration and an obligatory endpoint
    * Achievements
      * e.g. *die*, *trip*
      * events that occur at a single moment 
      * have no temporal structure
      * **no temporal duration**
      * instantanous culimination or termination
  * Manipulating **temporal properties** of events
    * **temporal duration**
    * **temporal termination**
      * lots of terminology associated, involving bounded/unbounded, telic/atelic, etc.
    * **internal temporal structure** or lack of
  * This classification correlates with distributional differences
    * Activities and accomplishments differ wrt temporal modifiers
      * Activities: Matilda walked along the road (\*in 10 minutes)/(for 10 minutes)
      * Accomplishments: Matilda consumed the pie (in 10 minutes)/(for 10 minutes)
    * States typically can not occur with progressive inflection
      * \*Matilda is knowing French
* This is detectable with morphology
  * some affixes select for a specific event type, some derivational processes introduce new event types
  * ex.
    * *-ation* selects for bases that denote telic events
        * hospitalize, hospitalization
        * solidify, solidification
        * ruin, ruination
        * walk, \*walkation
    * *-ify* derives accomplishments
      * pure, purify
      * french, frenchify
    * \(\emptyset\) N to V suffixes in English derive different structure depending on the root
      * root=manner of activity derives activities
        * job, run, creek, whistle
      * root=instrument derives activities
        * hammer, brush, saw, shovel
      * root=internally caused state derives change of state
        * bloom, blossom, decay, flower, rust
      * root=externally cuased state derives change of state
        * break, dry, harden, melt, open
  * Manipulation of event structure can also be seen distributionally
    * exm
      * The wax melted (cf. \*The wax melted by the sun)
      * The sun melted the wax (cf. \*the sun melted)
* Morphological marking of event structure is crosslinguistically varied.
  * Change in event structure that is null in one language may be marked in another
* Event types can be decomposed further as a combination of process and result
  * ex 
    * accomplishment has process + result
    * activity is just a process
    * achievement is just a result
  * results are understood as a culmination of a process
    * delimits an event, making it bounded
  * **complex events** introduce two or more subevents
    * detectable by syntactic ambiguities
      * "He opened the door again"
        * restitutive: subject causes door to return to state of being open
        * repetitive: subject opens the door, presupposed that this was done before
    * in syntax by distributional properties
    * in morphology by structure
* Events can be structured into inner and outer events
  * outer events
    * pertaining to causation and agency
  * inner events
    * pertaining to culmination, change of state
* Event types can be manipulated in syntax
  * ex
    * Matilda walked (unbounded, activity)/Matilda walked to the store (bounded, accomplishment)
  * has led to proposals to treat event structure morphology as syntactic
