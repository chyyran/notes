* Are there absolute universals?
  * vis-a-vis statistical trends
  * are universals genetic (formalist) or societal in speech act settings (functionalist)
* Universal inventory of features delimits rainge of possible persons
  * Some language use a participant/speaker system
  * There are universal constraints on possible morphemes
* What is the right way to specify features?
* 7 meta-persons
  * 1+2 (speakers and hearers, no others)
  * 1+2+3 (speakers and hearers and others)
  * 1 (speaker only)
  * 1+3 (speakers and others, hearers excluded)
  * 2 (hearers only)
  * 2+3 (hearers and others)
  * 3 (others only)
* Bobaljik argues that there is a universal set of feature systems limiting possible contrasts
  * Three cases concerning person marking involve well-formed and plausible contrasts that never occur
  * These occur because of universal constraints on possible morphemes arising from universal feature inventory
* We see a maximum of 4 way contrast
  * 1+2, 1+2+3 -> "inclusive" [+spk, -hr]
  * 1, 1+3 -> "exclusive" [+spk, -hr]
  * 2, 2+3 -> "second person" [-spk, +hr]
  * 3 -> "third person [-spk, -hr]
* Bobaljik proposes three universals 
  * on person
    1. No language distinguishes [1+1] from [1+3]
    2. No language distinguishes [2+2] from [2+3]
    3. No language distinguishes among [1+1+2], [1+2+2], and [1+2+3]
   * on form
    1. No language has a special morpheme for (true) [1 Pl]
    1. No language has a special morpheme for (true) [2 Pl]
    2. No language has a special morpheme for comprehensive person [1+2+3]
* to limit range of attested contrasts, we only have  a 2 feature system `[+/- speaker]` and `[+/- hearer]`. There is no third person 'feature'
  * this permits a maximum 4-way contrast
  * excludes exacly unattested distinctions
  * restrictions are on monomorphemic markers, not morpheme combinations
* Universal 1
  * No language distiguishes [1+1] from [1+3]
  * No language has a special morpheme for true 1Pl
  * Contexts where [1+1] (collective first person) would be natural
    * Greek drama
    * Sporting events (We are the champions)
    * Collective chanting
    * Religious rituals (group prayer)
  * Can we pluralize a first person?
    * usually means associative or group plural rather than multiplicity of individual speakers (p.210)
      * different kind of plural, not multiple individuals of same kind but assoc. of group
    * see this even in languages that permit general plural to combine with first person
    * U1 partially equivalent to saying [Pl + 1] can only be associative
* Universal 2
  * No second person exclusive
  * No language distinguishes 2 second person [2+2] from [2+3]
  * Possible counter examples
    * Abkhaz
      * has 2nd person inclusive/exclusive distinction
      * exclusive form is not atomic, -t also appears in demonstratives
      * is it you vs you(without me), NOT you vs. you(without3)
    * reflexive use of 自分
* Universal 3
  * No language distinguishes [1+1+2], [1+2+2], and [1+2+3]
  * No language has a special morpheme for comprehensive person [1+2+3]
