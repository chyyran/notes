* English speakers have some notion that in Spanish masculine ends in -o and feminine ends in -a
* Harris says that this is actually conflating gender class with declension class, as well as other noun classes
* In (3), we see masculine forms ending in -a and -e, and feminine forms ending in -o and -e.
* However its not as if anything goes. In (4) Harris provides examples of restrictions in morphological endings
  * The pairing of morphological suffix and noun are really important
  * It is not the case that the words are not phonosyntactically well formed but it is the grammatical restrictions that is the problem.
* Gender system of spanish is not a 2-way system
  * There is only a privative feminine feature, and everything is unmarked
  * Introduced diacritical privative form classes, with -o being the unmarked default class
  * Spanish nouns and adjectives end in a vowel is due to a prosodic template that normally is satisfied by a word marker (not always)
    * Forms like presidente (-e) are not actually a marker but a prosodic repair vowel to resyllabify 
* Systematic along 2 dimensions
  * generalizations particular to each of the categories that bear word markers
  * generalizations pertaining to subtypes of word markers
    * group together in 3 groups
      * inner core 
        * well behaved
        * -o is attached to masculine stems
        * -a is attached to feminine stems
      * outer core
        * no word marker but might have -e for syllabicity
      * residue
        * irregular
        * everything not in the core
        * most subclasses within it are tiny *-u only contains tribu)
        * not productive set
        * there is historic drift from core to residue (never vice versa)
* adverbs
  * no gender but do have word markers
  * shows independence of grammatical gender and form class
* adjectives
  * no inherent gender but get it through concord
  * show independence between grammtical gender and form class
    * must match gender of head noun, but does not need to match form class
  * classified into four types
    * inner core with -o (M) and -a (F)
    * outer core without word markers
    * gentilic (national/ethnic/geographical relevance)
      * no word marker in M
      * -a in feminine
    * residual where both M and F have -a marker
* classes are forme by their pairing
* nouns
  * all nouns have gender
  * human nows generally natch with grammatical gender
  * non-human, outer-core residue words can be freely masculine or feminine
  * large group of around 600 residue nouns ending in -a
  * only one -o femininine word
  * non-human nouns are not marked the same way, some are related using derivationa; adfffxiation
  * a few animal names are like human inner core nouns
  * mating
    * human nouns are mated
    * both a masculine and feminine form for human nouns
    * some rare exceptions to unmagted male/feminine human nouns
* form class
  * identifies -a formclass and none forclass
  * gender is totally underspecified by a masculine noun
  * redundancy rule which identitfies the -a form class on the basis if there is an +f feature on the lexical entry
* marker realization rule
  * to form level of nouns, insert suffixal /a/ if stem is marked ]a, otherwise /o/
  * +low picks up /a/, +round picks out /o/
  * being marked with ]\(\emptyset\) exempts the word from the rule
    * give sus the set that does not take word markers
    * **no mention of grammatical gender**
