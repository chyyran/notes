# 2021-10-16 Derivation

* Derivational morphology can be
  * Category-changing
    * Nominalizing (V/A -> N)
    * Verbalizing (N/A -> V)
    * Adjectivalizing (N/V -> A)
  * Meaning changing
    * compositionally or idiomatically
  * can be highly productive can also be non-productive
    * selectional reqs
    * blocking effects
    * transparency
    * lexicalizication
  * derivational morphemes can be cyclic or non-cyclic
  * can be phonologically fully specified or partially (prosodic) specified.
* Category changing morphology
  * correlated with patterns beyond a simple statement of the new category
  * meaning changes correlated with category-changing can be observed
  * often follows systematic patterns
  * other important properties, i.e. **argument structure**
* Nominalization
  * The most prominent form of category changing morphology
  * Nouns from verbs or adjectives
  * **Deverbal nouns**
    * Event nominalizations
      * deverbals that denote event or situation
        * eg.
          * elect, election
          * exam, examination
          * arrive, arrival
      * preserves argument structure of base V
      * permits modifiers that mirror those permitted by the verb
        * eg. 
          * The nation surprisingly elected an inexperienced leader.
          * The nation's surprising election of an inexperienced leader...
      * can occur with **temporal modifiers**
        * other nominals can not typically do 
        * ex. examined the debris **for two hours**
          * cf. \*examiner of the debris for two hours
    * Result nominalizations
      * deverbal nouns denoting a result related to the event expressed b y the B

    * Location nominalizations
      * denoting locations related to the event expressed by V
      * example

      * weak, weaken
    * change of state meanings often come in inchoative (anticausative)/causative pairs
      * causative entails causer, and inchoative is intransitive
      * example
        * The gap widened (Inchoative)
        * The crisis widened the gap (Causative)
    * sometimes we have causative only
      * example

    * sometimes we get inchoative only
  * **Denominal verbs**
    * often denotes change of place
    * also common to see where the N is interpreted as
      * an instrument that performs the action

  * **Deverbal adjectives**
    * Often participles, expressing the state arrived at after undergoing the event denoted by the action/process denoted by V
    * example
      * exhaust, exhausted
      * chasten, chastened
    * participles are part of the inflectional paradigm of the verb so their status as derivational affixes is controversial
    * can be object or subject referencing
      * object example
        * X washes Y
        * Y is washable
        * \*X is washable
      * subject referencing
        * X impresses Y
        * X is impressive
        * \*Y is impressive
    * some deverbal adjectives are modal, meaning denotes that base V can or must be done
      * expend/expendable
      * conceive, conceivable
