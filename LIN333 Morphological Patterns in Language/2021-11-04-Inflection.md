# 2021-11-04 Inflection

* inflection is word-formation that expresses some grammatical distinction
  * required by the syntactic use of a word, not lexemic derivation
  * recall three main kinds of root formation
    * derivation: root + affix
    * compounding: root + root
    * inflection: root + affix
* how should we differentiate affixal derivation vs affixal inflection?
  * compounding is the only root + root process so that is easy
  * meaning and function
    * derivaiton adds lexemic meaning
    * inflection signals some function in the syntax
      * relation to other elements in syntax
      * presence of syntactic features
    * cf work*er* (derivation) vs work*ed* (inflection)
  * category
    * derivation can change the category of a word, but inflection does not
  * morpheme order
    * inflectional affixes appear outside derivational affixes
    * cf. music.ian.s/\*music.s.ian
  * productivity
    * inflectional morphology is thought to be more productive than derivational morphology
## inflectional subcategory of verbs
* tense
  * concerned with sequence of events in real time
  * morphological expression of relation to time of an event wrt some reference point (usually moment of speech)
  * 3-way distinction: past/present/future
  * some languages only morphologically grammaticalize a subset of this distinction
    * english has NPST/PST
      * They will cook (FUT) (NPST)
      * They cook (PRES) (NPST)
      * They cook**ed** (PST)
    * some languages have FUT/NFUT 
  * some languages make many more distinctions
    * distant past, past, immediate past, present, immediate future, distant future, etc.
  * most often tense is part of the verb word or at least in the VP
    * within a language there can be variation whether tense is lexical, morphological, or periphrastic
      * is > was (lexical PST)
      * walk > walked (morphological PST)
      * eat > did eat (periphrastic PST)
  * tense is a syntactic category
    * whether or not a verb bears tense depends on syntactic configuration within clause
      * ex
        1. John eats cookies (PRES)
        2. John does not eat cookies (NEG.PRES)
        3. John has eaten cookies (PRES.PRF)
        4. John is eating cookies (PRES.PROG)
        5. John has been eating cookies (PRES.PRF.PROG)
      * notice that only (1) expresses tense on the verb. 
      * the auxillaries closest to the tense projection host the tense morphology
* aspect
  * temporal structural events
  * viewpoint aspect
    * whether the event expressed is complete or incomplete
    * different from whether it happens before or after the moment of speech
    * **perfective** aspect involves a complete event
    * **imperfective** (progressive) aspect involves an ongoing event
  * example
    * John has eaten cookies (PRES.PRF)
    * John had eaten cookies (PST.PRF)
    * John is eating cookies (PRES.PROG)
    * John was eating cookies (PST.PROG)
  * other categories
    * inceptive
      * starting point of an event
    * continuiative
      * middle of the event as it progresses
    * completive
      * completion of an event
    * semelfactive
      * action done only once
    * iterative
      * punctual event takes place several times in succession
    * habitual
      * action that is usually/characteristically done
* mood
  * speakers attitude towards a situation
  * belief in reality or likelihood
  * three forms
    * declarative
    * imperative
    * interrogative
  * ex
    * You closed the window (DECL)
    * Did you close the window? (INT)
    * Close the window! (IMP)
  * other moods
    * realis 
      * asserts that an event or state of affairs has actually happened
      * affirmative declaratives
    * irrealis
      * indicates that the situation is not known to have happened
      * interrogatives
      * negated declaratives
    * evidentiality
      * relative degree of certainty
      * second-hand vs direct experience
* modality
  * expresses possibility (might), obligation (must), necesscity, desire, etc.
  * epistemic modality
    * possibility of a proposition being true
  * deontic modality
    * concerned with proposition wrt freedom of action
    * obligation, permission
* agreement
  * indexing on the verb selected features of the argument
  * ex
    * Marco sleep*s* until 8am every morning (1.SG)
    * We sleep until 8am every morning
  * some languages track multiple arguments with agrement
  * agreement can have complex rules and can be sensitive to specific features
* class
  * some languages have more than one set of inflectional markers with the same function
  * for example, -er vs -ir verbs in French
  * 一段 vs 五段 verbs in Japanese
  * root property (lexically specified) that determines which inflectional set to use
  * in English we have strong/weak verb contrast
    * sing/sang (Strong)
    * cook/cooked (Weak)
