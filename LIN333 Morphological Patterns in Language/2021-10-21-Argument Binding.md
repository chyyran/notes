# 2021-10-21 Argument Binding

* There are sometimes cases where 2 arguments are bundled together and are saturated by one thing
* When nominalize with *-er*, somehting odd happens
  * I consider **these lions**`<R=Ag> [to be eaters of **meat**`<TH>]
    * The agent and the referent has been bundled!
    * The two theta-roles of the head are being bound together
  * > **def'n** Argument Binding
    > A nominalizing morpheme may be lexically specified to bind one of the internal arguments it inherits via substitution.
  * We indicate this with superscripts **within the argument structure of a single node**
