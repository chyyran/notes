# 2021-09-30 Cyclic and Non-cyclic Morphology

* Not all phonological processes result in allomorphy
  * There are phonological processes that are not sensitive to morphological structure
    * For example, intervocalic flapping \(/t,d/ \to [D] / \`V\_V\) applies in fast speech
    * This rule is applied regardless of morphological structure
      * rider (rid-er) \(/d/ \to [D]\)
      * ladder \(/d/ \to [D]\)
      * She'll **ride her** bike tomorrow. (across word boundaries)
    * The rule applies whenever the **structural environment** (phonological environment) applies
  * Rules that affect the pronounciation of morphemes in this trivial sense are called **across-the-board (ATB) rules**, or **post-lexical** rules.
    * ATB rules wherever they can
    * Insensitive to morphology 
    * So pervasive speakers are usually unaware without training.
    * Examples
      * Canadian raising \(aɪ \to ʌɪ, æw \to ʌw / \_ C [-voice]\)
      * Aspiration of voiceless stops \(/p, t, k/ \to /p^h, t^h, k^h/\) with simple syllable onsets
    * General properties
      * Can create new allophones
      * Automatic and exceptionless
      * Insensitive to morphological structure
* Not all morphemes participate in allomorphy
  * Some classes of rules are morphologically sensitive (**cyclic**)
    * g-deletion \(ŋ.gər \to ŋər\)
      * Only occurs between morpheme boundaries
      * finger \([fɪŋ.gər] / *[fɪŋ.ər]\) vs singer \(*[sɪŋ.gər] / [sɪŋ.ər]\)
    * Other examples
      * \(k \to s\) public, publication / electric, electricity
      * \(t \to s\) democrat, democracy
      * \(g \to dj\) analog, analogy
      * palatalization \(/s/ \to /ʃ/ / \_ \text{high vowel/glide}\)
        * face, facing vs. facial
        * race, racing, racer, vs racial
    * general properties
      * Sensitive to morphological structure and only triggered by certain morphemes
      * Do not apply to non-derived (simple) words
      * Typically relate one phoneme to another
      * Often have lexically specificied exceptions
* Cyclic vs non-cyclic affixes
  * We can classify affixes according to whether or not they trigger cyclic rules.
    * Affixes that trigger cyclic rules are **cyclic** or **non-neutral**
    * Affixes that do not are **non-cyclic** or **neutral**
  * Cyclic affixes
    * *-ic*
      * 'strategy/stra'tegic
      * 'morpheme/mor'phemic
      * 'democrat/demo'cratic
    * *-ee*
      * de'tain/detai'nee
      * absent/absen'tee
      * employ/emplo'yee
   * Non-cyclic affixes
     * *-ness*
       * abstract/abstractness
       * serious/seriousness
     * *-er*
       * parade/parader
       * destroy/destroyer
       * believe/believer
   * Non-cyclic affixes do not trigger phonological change
   * The difference has been developed in different ways
     * **lexical phonology/morphology** divides the lexicon in **strata**
       * Cyclic and non-cyclic morphemes belong to distinct strata
     * Distinction as a lexical property in a generative approach
       * Cyclic affixes have **weak** (+) boundaries
       * Non-cyclic affixes have **strong** (#) boundaries
   * Some more cyclic affixes
     * stress shift
       * *-ion* operate/operation, imitate/imitation
       * *-ity* produtive/productivity, inclusive/inclusivity
       * *-ian* grammar/grammarian, history/historian
     * Trisyllabic Laxing \(V \to [-\text{tense}] / \_ \sigma.\sigma.\#\)
       * Tense vowel becomes a lax vowel when it is followed by 2 syllables
       * examples
         * divine/divinity
         * serene/serenity
         * sane/sanity
 * Affix ordering
   * cyclic affixation occurs before non-cyclic affixation
   * consider affix ordering
     * *-ism* vs *-ian*
       * examples
         * Mendel/Mendel-ian/Mendel-ian-ism/*Mendel-ism-ian
         * Shakespeare/Shakespear-ian/Shakespear-ian-ism/*Shakespear-ism-ian
       * Both *-ism* and *-ian* are N and subcategorize to N
         * Their subcategorization predicts that the order is free, but it is not.
       * Ordering restriction is not explained by subcategorization
       * If we posit that cyclic affixation proceeds before non-cyclic then we see that *-ian* is cyclic, and *-ism* is non-cyclic
       * Another proposal is that cyclic affixes are **root-attaching** 
         * Root attachment is a selectional requirement, whereas non-cyclic affixes do not have this selection
 * Blocking effects
   * A cyclic affix tends to block non-cyclic affixes with the same function
     * *-ant* vs *-er*
       * applicant/\*applier
       * accountant/\*accounter
       * participant/%participator
       * intoxicant/%intoxicator
     * Conversion between N and V
       * nouns derived from verbs involve affixation of a cyclic null affix
       * verbs derived from nouns involve a non-cyclic null affix
       * V to N
         * sur'vey 'survey
         * tor'ment 'torment
         * pro'test 'protest
       * N to V
         * 'pattern 'pattern \*pat'tern
         * 'patent 'patent \*pa'tent
         * 'lever 'lever \*le'ver
       * V to N cyclic null affix could explain unavalibility of productive *-er* affixation, i.e. spy/spy/*spier
* Rule ordering
  * cyclic phonological rules can be thought of as a block of rules that apply when a cyclic affix is attached to a base
  * If multiple cyclic  affixes are attached within the same word, then the block of rules will be cycled through each time a cyclic affix is added
  * Non cyclic affixes do not trigger a cycle
  * This gives us an overall format for morphophonological derivations
  * Format
    * **Input** (UR of root) /root/
      * No rules here
    * **Cyclic affixation** root + /affix/
      * Attach cyclic affix if present
      * MS rules apply
      * Repeat for each cyclic affix root-aff + /affix/
    * **Non-cyclic affixation**
      * Attach non-cyclic if there is one
      * No rules here
      * Repeat for non-cyclic affix
    * ATB rules
      * apply to entire structure
    * **Output** (surface form of derived word) [phonetic form]
* Strict cycle condition
  * MS-rules are strictly ordered so that they can only apply at the point in the derivation where they have been triggered by a cyclic affix.
  * At other points, even if the context of the rule can be found in the derived string, MS rules will not apply
  * MS-rules can not be triggered in environments derived by non-cyclic affixes
  * example:
    * *-ous* is a cyclic affix triggering trisyllabic laxing and palatalization
      * omen/ominous
      * right/righteous
    * Why don't we get trisyllabic laxing in *righteousness*?
      * TSL in *righteousness* is prohibited by strict cycle condition
      * The structural description for TSL is not created when attaching *-ous*, but once we attach *-ness*
* Over and under application
  * With the cycles of MS rulee, we get interesting rule ordering effects of apparent over or underapplication
  * **underapplication**: where the structural description of a rule seems to be met but does not apply
  * **overapplication**: where the structural description of a rule is not met but the rule applies
  * *-ify*
    * Cyclic affix triggering TSL
    * examples
      * clear/clarify
      * vile/vilify
    * What happens when we also add *-ication*
      * example
        * clarification
        * vilification
      * We expect TSL to occur to antepenultimate syllable
      * We also see TSL applies to initial syllable which is unexpected as V is followed by more than 2 syllables
    * We cycle twice, and TSL applies twice
      * `[[[clear]-ify]-cation]`
  * We have interactions with ATB rules also showing apparent over/under application
    * *writer* undergoes both raising and flapping because raising applies before flapping, cf. *rider*
