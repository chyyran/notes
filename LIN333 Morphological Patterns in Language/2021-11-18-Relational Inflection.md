# 2021-11-18 Relational Inflection

* Inflection marked on nouns in relation to other elements in the phrase structure.

## Case
* Arguments are marked by morphemes which signal their grammatical function
  * Example (Japanese)
    * が (SUBJ/NOM)
    * を (OBJ/ACC)
    * に (IND.OBJ/DAT)
  * Traditionally in Nom-Acc languages subject case is called nominative case, and the case that marks object is accusative case
* Case markers
  * Nominative: subject
  * Accusative: objects
  * Dative: indirect objects
  * Genitive: posessors
* Little case in modern English
* **Structural case** is when a case marker transparently indicates a noun's function
* Sometimes case is assigned in connection with the *semantic role* a noun has. This is called **inherent case**.
* Non-core arguments and non-arguments also get morphological case (oblique case)
* Case can also be introduced by prepositions
  * ex. instrumentive with [PP. with]
### Nom-acc/Erg-abs
* nominative-accusative case systems
  * subject of a transitive verb and subject of an intransitive verb get the same case morphology
  * English
    * **She** read the book
    * **She** danced
  * Often have special forms for accusative objects
* Ergative-absolutive case systems
  * transitive and intransitive subjects do not get the same morphological case
  * subject of an intransitive verb gets the same case ending as the object of a transitive verb
  * example (inuktitut):
    * > *arna-up angut taku-jaa*
      > woman-case man(case) see-3.sg 
      > The woman sees the man
    * > *angut sinik-tuq*
      > man(case) see-3.sh
      > The man is sleeping 
## Concord
* similar to agreement (see Week 9)
* morphology that appears on other things on the noun phrase
* where specifiers in an NP share selected features of the head noun.
* For example, determiner/adjective gender agreement in romance language
## Non-relational categories
* Inflectional form of a noun is determined by a number of tranitionally non-relational categories
  * person (pronouns)
  * gender/noun class 
    * gender is inherent to the noun but it is visible to the syntax
  * animacy
  * number
  * definiteness
* **person**
  * many languages make a 3-way distinction
    * 1 (speaker-participant)
    * 2 (addressee-participant)
    * 3 (non-participant)
  * inclusive/distinction
    * 1.excl (we = speaker + someone other than addressee)
    * 1.incl (we = you and me)
* **gender and noun class**
  * nouns in many languages are lexically specified as belonging to lexical classes
  * in indoeuropean typically we find a 2 or 3-way Masc/Fem/Neut
    * assignment is arbitrary
    * relation between classes and conceptual gender is arbitrary
    * gender categories and declension or form class is often confused and the distinction is hard to draw
  * some languages go far beyond a 3-way split hand have a 20 or 30 lexical class
    * start to see lexical functions such as shape, size, and function
* **animacy**
  * differentiates nouns on how sentient or alive the referent of the noun is
  * sometimes expressed on the noun itself but often seen in morphosyntactic environment
  * some languages have a simple alive/inanimate binary, some languages have a hierachy
    * navajo has Human > Infant/Big animal > Medium sized animal > Small animal > natural force > abstraction 
  * often a degree of arbitrary-ness
    * many linguists treat animacy as a subset of noun class or gender
    * inanimate referents may be grammatically animate
    * referents can be highly animate depending on belief systems
* **number**
  * expresses contrast involving countable quantities
  * not all languages mark number morphologically
  * some languages do not mark number at all
  * some numbers only marks on certain types of nouns
    * japanese only mark numbers on animate nouns (人・人たち)
  * simplest distinction is sg/pl
  * three way distinction is singular/dual/pl
  * some languages has a 4-way sg/dl/tl/pl
    * some have sg/dl, paucaul (few), pl
  * some languages (ex. tlingit) distinguish collective vs individual
    * cf. people assembled as a group (pl) vs multiple people who are not assembled as a group
* **definiteness**
  * whether or not the noun has previously been introduced in discourse or if it is understood in a salient way
  * can be marked using determiners in English or with bound morphology
  * important to nominal inflection in some languages
  * for example, some languages only mark case on definites or require movement
