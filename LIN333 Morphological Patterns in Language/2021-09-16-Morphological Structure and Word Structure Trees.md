# 2021-09-16 Morphological Structure and Word Structure Trees

* Morphemes combine to create morphological structure, which is representred with Word Structure Trees (WSTs)
  * un-lock `[V [Aff un-] [V lock]]`
  * speak-er `[N [V speak] [Aff -er]]
  * digit-al-lize `[V [A [N digit] [Aff -al]] [Aff -ize]]`
* WSTs capture category of the base, of the complex form, and order of composition
* Some word structure trees are potentially ambiguous but remember we project the category of the root.
  * un-speak-able `[A [Aff un-] [A [V speak] [Aff -able]]]`
* Some words have structural ambiguity with distinct interpretations
  * "Able to be unlocked" un-lock-able `[A [V [Aff un-] [V lock]] [Aff -able]]`
  * "Not lockable" un-lock-able `[A [Aff un-] [A [V lock] [Aff -able]] ]`
* Morphological structures are restricted by lexical entries
* Not all complex forms are compositional
  * When a complex structure is not composition it is **idiomatic**.
  * This is also true in phrase structure, e.g. "kicked the bucket" -> "died"
  * We have it at the morphological level as well
    * stool pidgeon, pickpocket, butterfingers
    * *consider-able* is not "able to consider" but instead is an expression of magnitude
  * Where do we get idiomatic meaning?
* The member of the WST that determines the category of the whole is the head
* Types of word formation
  * Derivation
    * Creating a new lexeme by changing the category or meaning of the base
    * English derivation follows Right-hand head rule (RHHR)
      * The head of a derived form is always the element on the right of a branching structure
  * Inflection
    * Does not create new lexemes but new wordforms of the same lexeme
    * Required by the position of the function in a sentence, e.g. read (-s/-ing)
    * Understood as requirements placed upon by syntactic structure
  * Compounding
    * Free morphemes attaching to one another to form compound words
    * A form of derivational morphology which affects category and meaning
    * Lots of different combinations are possible in English
    * RHHR applies!
* Some languages have a Left-hand head rule such as Vietnamese and Hebrew
  * Vietnamese [N  nha 'person'] + [V thuong 'be wounded'] = [N nha-thong 'hospital']
* **Exocentric** compounds do not obey the head rule of their language, and tend to be idiomatic
  * Most of them involve prepositional compounds such as [P under] + [N water] = [A underwater]
  * Some of them are idiomatic, such as *pickpocket*, *butterfingers*, *stool pidgeon*
  * Compounds that do obey the head rule and whose heads are interpreted compositionally (not idiomatically) are known as **endocentric**.
* Compounds seem similar to phrases but behave more like words
  * Stress patterns are like words, for example ['black.bird] vs [black 'bird]
    * compare ['doc.tor, 'sta.tion]
  * Internal parts of the compound can not be modified
    1. \*the very White House
    2. the very white house on the corner
  * Inflection can not appear inside the compound
    * \*hubs cap
    * hub caps
