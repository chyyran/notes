# 2021-10-07 Prosodic Morphology

* Remember that prosody refers to suprasegmental subdivisions in a language over individual segments
  * syllables, feet, morae, words, phrases
* We want to see patterns between prosodic elements and morphological processes
* Very useful for non-concatenative morphology
  * The form of the morpheme is not limited to a string of phonologically realizable segments
  * The most simple is the null affix
* It's well known that prosodic phonology can produce complex patterns
  * If you pay enough attention to the prosodic representation of affixes, they are actually very well behaved
  * They are just not realized phonologically on the surface realization
* Autosegmental phonology
  * Theory began with the theory of tone and how tone was realized/associated with segments
  * Tone begins in its own representational tier/layer separate from the segmental layer
  * Each tone segment is mapped to a segment in a segmental layer
  * We can tell this is independent because there are phonological processes that target one tier without changing another tier
    * Tones can be disassociated and reassociated with a different segment, particularly if a vowel in the segmental layer was deleted
  * the mapping does not have to be 1-to-1
    * A vowel can be associated with two tones or vice versa
  * We actually have an abstract **skeletal tier** of consonants and verb templates that associate tones, and segments are also associated to this tier.
  * Universal Linking Condition
    * A sequence of autosegments are linked with elements on the skeletal tier that are capable of bearing them
      * For example, you can't link tones with consonants
    * Linking goes from one edge to another following relevant rules, unless specific instructions are given in the language grammar
    * Association lines should not cross
  * For example, geminant consonants are mapped as a single segment to a tier `CC`
  * Vowel lengthening being 'spread' from the surface layer to an unmatched `V` in the skeletal tier
* Pattern morphology
  * Many Semitic languages have "root-and-pattern" morphology
    * One morpheme would interleave/interlock with others
  * Arabicx`
    * All the consonants for *write* have 'ktb'
    * The UR for all these concepts are just the unpronounceable **ktb**
    * There isn't just a single substring for passive/active
      * Also no continuous affix
      * We do see a systematic association
    * a vowel melody from a layer spreads across the morphemic template
* Reduplication
  * Very common to see partial reduplication
    * Only part of the base is copied
    * The idea is that the morphemes have a CV template that is underspecified or only partially specified 
    * The plural reduplication morpheme has no phonological segmental layer, but triggers a 'repair' from the segmental tier following the template it introduces
    * Whatever residue remains is deleted
