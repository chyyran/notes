# 2021-09-16 Allomorphy

* A single morpheme can have more than one phonological form
  * English plural /-z/ can be [s/z/ə] depending on its environment
    * This is a single plural with an underlying representation
    * These forms are entirely predictable from phonological context, and are in complementary distribution
* Linguists use the term **morpheme** to refer to the *abstract underlying representation* of the surface **allomorphs**. 
  * If a morpheme only has one surface form it is a **morph**
  * If there is an alternation of morphs then they are **allomorphs**
* Allomorphs are **conditioned** in different ways
  * Phonological conditioning
    * For the English plural, it is entirely based on phonological environment
      * [-s] when base ends in voiceless stop
      * [-z] when base ends in voiced stop
      * [-əz] when base ends in 'strident' segments like affricates 
  * Morphological conditioning
    * An affix conditions the choice of allomorph
    * In English, we have an example in goose and geese with a null-plural affix that changes the phonological expression from UR /gus/ to /gis/
  * Lexical conditioning
    * A choice of root conditions the choice of allomorph
    * In English, we have sg/pl fish, where the root fish conditions the irregular null pl affix.
  * Suppletion
    * Where the allomorphs of a root are entirely (or almost entirely) unrelated with respect to phonological representations and can involve non-cognate forms
    * In English, examples are go/went, or good/better/best, or in the copular am/are/is.
