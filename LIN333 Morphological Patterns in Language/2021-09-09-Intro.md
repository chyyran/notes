* Morphology is the study of word formation
* **What is a word?**
  * some possible explanations
    * a part of language that expresses some shared meaning between a language community 
      * necessary but not sufficient to distinguish what a word is
      * mutual understanding must generalize to any level of structure
        * any meaning-mapped structure in natural language is mutually understandable
    * a unit that can stand on its own in a sentence
    * units you can string together to form bigger constituents
    * arbitrarily determined with respect to its boundaries
    * words reflect conceptual boundaries
    * unit has meaning, phonological representation (externalization), and interacts with the grammar in a meaningful way
      * should we exclude onomatopoeia
      * are onomatopoeia more generalized? sound symbolism?
  * **There is no consensus**
* **How do we distinguish words from other levels of structure?**
  * Distinguishing between words and sentences is clear in English but not necessarily in other (agglutinative) languages
  * Words in different languages don't all look the same
    * Analytic languages have very little internal structure in words
    * Agglutinating languages can have words with a lot of internal structure
    * Polysynthetic languages can fit the equivalent of multiple clauses in a word
  * Larger constituents can be formed with words
    * 'string together' was thought to be the dominant model before current structural models
  * Stand alone by itself?
    * Functionally? Can we just use 'tree' by itself? (i.e. *Tree is in bloom)
    * What knowledge is being accessed when a speaker makes a boundary judgment
      * Phonological constraints? What is long/short enough to be prosodic/aprosodic 
  * A word interacts intimately with
    * Syntax
    * Phonology
    * **Memory and cognitiion**
      * How much do we store and how much do we compose?
      * ex. past tense vs irregular past tense
        * walked/walk
        * eat/ate?
* Morphology is generative
  * we introduce words all the time
  * the process of word introduction is governed by rules
  * There are multiple word formation processes at multiple levels
    * Consider "black.board" vs "walk.ed"
    * Three main ways
      * derivation
      * compounding
      * inflection
  * "Productivity", there are a lot of restrictions in producing a word
  * It also happens at different places
  * non-concatenative and prosodic morphology
  * affects argument structure, event structure, can radically change the distribution of a word in a sentence
* **What is the difference between a word and a phrase**
  * Permutability tests
    * Word morphemes are not as freely permuted as phrase constituents are
    * Example:
      * I didn't see snowboarders.
      * Snowboarders, I didn't see. (Topicalized)
      * \*Snow, I didn't see boarders
      * \*Snowboard, I didn't see -ers.
      * \*Ers, I didn't see snowboard
  * Separability
    * It is not very easy to separate words
    * doghouse vs \*doghouse
  * Extraction
    * A version of the permutability test
    * A phrase can be "extracted"
      * They've been [American history teachers] for years
      * [American history teachers], which they've been __ for years.
    * A word is not so easily extracted
      * They've been [American history] teachers for years
      * \*[American history], which they've been __ teachers for years
      * \*[American history], which they've been it teachers for years
  * Conjoinability
    * We can not coordinate within word structure
    * Example
      * Mary outran and outswam Bill
      * \*Mary outran and -swam Bill
    * Example
      * John's joyfulness and cheeriness kept us going
      * \*John's joyful- and cheeriness kept us going
  * Gapping
    * Comma is used for the gap
    * We can't gap with a subpart of a word, but gapping is possible at the level of a phrase
    * example
      * John outran Bill and Mary, Patrick
      * \*John outran Bill and Mary, -swam Patrick
    * example
      * John liked the play and Mary, the movie
      * \*John liked the play and Mary, dis- it
  * Inbound anaphoric islands
    * Within a word, we can not use a pronoun anaphorically or dictictally
    * McCarthyite vs \*himite
  * Phrasal recursivity
    * phrases are recursive, but words are not
    * Example
      * [A happy]-ness
      * \*[AP quite happi]-ness
      * \*[AP more happy [than sad]]-ness
* Lexical integrity hypothesis
  * Syntactic operations do not apply to the subparts of words
  * **Lexicalist hypothesis**: The system of grammar that derives words is separate and different from the one that derives phrases from words
    * came to prominence in the 60s and 70s but since come under increasing scrutiny
  * Head movement in syntax (i.e V-to-T) could be a source for word formation since it acquires some tense semantics
    * If you're building words via syntactic structure this conflicts with the lexicalist hypothesis
* Definitions
  * > *def'n* *Morphemes**
    > 
    > smallest meaningful unit of language
  * > *def'n* **Roots**
    >  
    > the morpheme that expresses the main meaning of a word
  * > *def'n* **Affixes**
    > 
    > Affixes attach to a base to add some meaning. The base can be a root but it can also be something bigger.
  * > *def'n* **Bound morphemes**
    >  
    > Morphemes that can only appear attached to another morpheme.
    > The hyphen appears on the bound edge 
  * > *def'n* **Free morphemes**
    > 
    > A morpheme that can stand alone
* Types of affixes
  * **Suffixes** attach to the right of a base
  * **Prefixes** attach to the left of the base
  * **Infixes** attach inside a base
  * **Circumfixes** attach on both sides of a base
  * Zero-affixation
    * very productive in english, a phonologically null affix
    * example
      * staple (N) -> staple (V)
      * glue (N) -> glue (V)
  * stem change affixes
    * Affixes that change the base/stem
    * run + PAST -> ran
    * goose + PL -> geese
  * suprasegmental affixes
    * affects prosodic properties of the base
      * permit/permit
      * convict/convict (V)
