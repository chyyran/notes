# 2021-09-16 Morphemes and Lexical Entries

* Words have other words inside of them
  * We want to try and find a 1-1 mapping from form to meaning
  * For example we have from 'general'
    * general
    * general-ize
    * general-ization
  * In terms of indivisibility we have the following constituents
    * general
      * ? gener-al
      * This could be attested from *gener-ate*, or *gener-ic*, but does this truly encapsulate the same semantic content?
      * We also have attested **-al** or **-ic** like *natur-**al*** or *condition-**al***
      * We can't decide this just by looking at *general* but have to look at substrings
    * -ize
      * What is the meaning of *-ize*?
      * A -> "make" V would make sense here (where we have *general* is A). 
        * We know this from distribution, e.g. "a [AP very general] claim"
      * This would possibly not apply to *hospital-ize* since *hospital* is N, and *hospital-ize*, so can we characterize it as X -> "make" V?
      * We have a good set of data to characterize A -> "make" V.
        * special-ize
        * visual-ize
        * random-ize
        * custom-ize
        * external-ize
        * internal-ize
      * What about this set of bound forms?
        * anal-yze (note that orthography here is irrelevant in this case)
        * strateg-ize
        * agon-ize
        * ?organ-ize
          * How does the meaning compose here? "organize" does not mean "make  organ".
        * synchron-ize
      * The following bound forms are more clear N -> "make" V
        * stabil-ize
        * symbol-ize
        * politi-cize
      * The most expedient decision would just be to consider free forms and bound forms. Then we can say *-ize* has meaning free A -> "make" V.
    * -ation
  * We can say that *-ize* and *-ation* are most certainly indivisible constituents. 
    * For example we can not break down *hospital* in *hospital-ization* any further
    * We can *posit* meaning that maps to form but we have to be able to attest that the mapping occurs in the language to be able to conclude it is a morpheme.
      * We can not make the form *\*h-ear* where *h-* means "make use of", since we do not have forms like *\*h-eye*. 
  *  > *def'n* morpheme
     >  
     > The minimal unit of form and meaning
     * This has some problems, since null morphemes have no form
     * It's not clear that all morphemes have meaning
     * Consider *trauma(t)-ize*
       * Is the *t* a morpheme unto itself?
       * Perhaps the *t* is an alternation of *-ize*.
  * Morpheme based approach means that building blocks of morphemes are other morphemes.
  * Terms like 'words' or 'lexeme' are descriptively useful but have no real status
  * There are some word-based approaches
* To track morphemes systematically we use a **lexical entry**
  * What a grammar has to know about a morpheme to account for its distribution
  * Fields for "hospital-ize"
    * Labels: "hospital" + "ize"
    * Form: /hospitel/ /ijz/ (ersatz IPA here)
    * Meaning: HOSPITAL + make __
    * Attachment: _ + [ X_ ]
    * Category: N + V
    * Subcat: _ + [ {A, N} _ ]
    * Selection: _ + { -ic/-al/...?}
