# 2021-10-27 Topology

* Distributed memory architector
  * Different machines with own DRAM and Cache
  * Connected via a network
* Historical perspective
  * early DMMs were a collection of microprocessors
  * communication performed usign bidirectional queues between nearest neighbours
  * messages forwarded by processors on path
  * "store and forward" networking
  * strong emphasis on topology iin algorithms to minimize number of hops = minimize time"
* Network analogy
  * Not just bus as in shared memory
  * like streets
    * link = street
    * switch = intersection
    * distances (hops) = blocks traveled
    * routing algorithm = travel plan
  * properties
    * latency = how long to get between nodes in the network
    * bandwidth = how much data can be moved per unit time
      * limited by bitrate per wire and number of wires
* Design characteristics of a network
  * Topology
    * crossbar, ring, 2-D, 3D, higher-D mesh, torus, hypercube, tree, butterfly
  * Routing algorithm
    * primary objective is to avoid deadlock
  * switching strategy
    * circuit switching: full path reserved for entire message, like telephone
    * packet switching: message broken into separately routed packets like post office or internet
  * flow control
    * what to do if there is congestion
    * stall, store data in temp buffers, reroute to other nodes, tell source nodes to halt, discard, etc.
