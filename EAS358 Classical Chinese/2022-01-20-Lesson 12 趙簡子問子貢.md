## Text 趙簡子問子貢 from 說苑
* could not find proper 書き下し so most of these are made up and incomplete

* 趙簡子問子貢曰，孔子為人何如。
  * Zhao Jian Zi asks Zi Gong, what type of person is Confucius?
    * 孔子為人
  * 何如 -> natural word order is 如何 but its been inverted to emphasize the question
    * other constructions like 以何 (how) -> 何以
  * 趙簡子、子貢に問ひて曰わく、「孔子の人と為り何如（いかん）」と。
* 子貢對曰，賜不能識也。
  * Zigong replied: I am unable to know.
  * 對: to face
  * object is implied to be 趙簡子
  * the 也 makes it almost nominal but emphasizes the fact, categorical factual statement
    * there is no way that Zigong will be able to know him, no possibility
  * 子貢対（こた）えて曰く：賜知る能はざるなりと
* 簡子不說曰，夫子事孔子數十年終業而去之。
  * 說 is not "to speak" but "to delight" (same as 悅)
    * Jianzi was not pleased
    * also means to persuade
  * 事 -> to serve
  * 夫 -> now, rhetorical marker
  * Jianzi was not satisfied: master you have served Confucius for several decades, completed your training and left.
  * [X 不說] [Y 夫子事孔子數十年終業而去之。]
  * 去 -> 去る
  * 數十年 can be dropped -> implied that X/Y can be preserved in
    * [X 事孔子數十年] [Y 終而去之]
    * 數十年 is (number) complement of VP [事孔子] (NC)
      * always number + measure word in Comp,VP position
  * 簡子悦(よろこ)ばざりて曰く: 夫、子、数十年に孔子を仕えて業を終えて去る
* 寡人問子，子曰不能識，何也。
  * 寡: honorific first person pronoun for a ruler
  * I asked you a question, and you said you can not know, how is this possible.
  * [T 寡人問子，子曰不能識] [C 何也。]
  * 寡人、子を問う。子曰く知る能はざると、何ぞや
* 子貢曰賜譬渴者之飲江海。知足而已。
  * 譬 is a verb with embedded sentence and use as metaphor
  * Zigong said: I am like the thirsty man who is drinking from the rivers and oceans. I know when I have enough and stop.
    * [V 譬] [C 渴者之飲江海。知足而已]
    * 子貢曰く：譬へ賜は江海を飲む渴者。足るを知りて已む (?)
* 孔子猶江海也， 賜則奚足以識之。
  * 猶 -> resemble (猶ほ .. のごとき)
  * 奚 -> by what, equivalent to 何以
  * 則: contrastive focus
  * Confucius is like the rivers and seas. How would I be adequate in order to know him?
  * [T 孔子猶江海也] [C 賜則奚足以識之。]
  * Take 奚 as modifier of [C 足以識之] turning it into a question
  * 足 is an auxillary verb "to be adequate to do somehting
    * [[CV以 V識] 之]
  * 孔子猶ほ江海のごときなり賜
* 簡子曰善哉子貢之言也。
  * Jian Zi said: spendlid are the words of zigung
  *  簡子曰く「子貢の言、善哉也り」と
  *  [T 善哉] [C 子貢之言也]
     *  We can flip it but if we treat [T 善哉] as topic with [C 子貢之言也] in adjunct position (modifier)
### Personnae, notes
* 子貢: Zi Gong, disciple of confucius
  * First person is by saying your own name (humble oneself)
  * 賜 is his courtesy name
* Confucius
  * Jesuits translated 孔子 to Confucius
* Common rhetorical tone that inferior figure gives some preposterous response to a question from the authority figure
