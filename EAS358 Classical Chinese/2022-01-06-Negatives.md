## Text: 矛盾 (韓非子)
1. 楚人有鬻盾與矛者，譽之曰 「吾盾之堅，（物）莫能陷也。」
   * In the Chu there was a seller of shields and spears. Praising his shields, he said that there was no other shield that was as sturdy, and that no thing would be able to penetrate it.
   * 楚人に盾と矛とを鬻（ひさ）ぐ者有り。之(これ)を誉めて曰はく、「吾が盾の堅きこと、能（よ）く陥（とお）す（物）莫（な）きなり。」
   * 物 could have been omitted
2. 又譽其矛曰「吾矛之利，於物無不陷也。」
   * Also, praising his spears, he said, "my spears are so sharp, there was nothing that it could not impale"
   * 又其の矛を誉（ほ）めて曰はく、「吾が矛の利（と）きこと、物に於(お)いて陥（とお）さざる無きなり。」と。
     * 於 (locative marker)
3. 或曰「以子之矛陷子之盾，何如。」
   * One person said. What happens when you take one of your spears, and one of your shields, and stab it?
   * 或るひと曰はく、「子の矛を以つて、子の盾を陥（とお）さば何如（いかん）。」
     * 何如: What happens?
4. 其人弗能應也。
   * (The seller) was unable to respond.
   * This is a transposition of 其人不能應之也
5. 夫不可陷之盾與無不陷之矛不可同世而立。
   * 夫(そ)れ陷(とお)すべからざるの楯(たて)と陷らざる無きの矛(ほこ)とは、世を同じくして立つべからず。
   * Now, an impenetrable shield and a spear that can penetrate all can not simultaenously exist
