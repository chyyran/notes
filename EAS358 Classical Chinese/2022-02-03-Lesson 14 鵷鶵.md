# 2022-02-03 Lesson 14 鵷鶵

## Lesson 12 sentence patterns
* using 哉 in rhetorical inversions
* 孔子曰: 勇哉士乎憤憤者乎
  * [T 勇哉士乎] [C 憤憤者乎]
    * Two 乎 (emphatic) indicates 2 sentences
      * 哉 indicates exclamative use of 乎
        * "sentence-medial particle indicating inverted construction for the emphasis of the predicate"
    * "How brave is this soldier. he is so impassioned"
  * [T 勇哉] [C 士乎]
    * "How brave is this officer!?"
  * 憤憤者乎
    * "He is so impassioned!"
## Text 鵷鶵 (荘子)
* Context
  * First 7 chapters make a point directly but later chapters seem to be added on
  * 惠子 is a conventional thinker that goes against the Daoist philosophy, but 荘子 is a Daoist philosopher.

* 惠子相梁。莊子往見之。
  * 惠子 is serving as the minister in Liang (capital of the state of Heui)
  * Hui Zi serving as minister in Liang, and Zhuang Zi went to visit
  * 恵子梁に相たり。荘子往きて之を見る。
  * [T 惠子] [C 相梁] [T 莊子] [C 往見之]
    * 見 here means 'to have an audience'
* 或謂惠子曰，莊子來欲代子相。
  * "Someone told Hui Zi that Zhuang Zi is coming and wants to replace you as prime minister"
  * 或ひと恵子に謂(い)いて曰く: 荘子来り、子に代りて相たらんと欲す、と。
  * 或 -> 人或 (人) elided
  * 莊子來欲代子相
    * Two options here, can take 莊子 as topic, or 莊子來 as topic
      * "Zhuang Zi is coming, and he is here to repalce you as prime minister"
      * "Zhuang Zi's coming is to replace you as prime minister"
      * First option makes more sense because he wouldn't know that Zhuang Zi's purpose is to replace him
  * [V 欲 [V 代子] 相]
    * "He wants to replace you as prime minister"
* 於是惠子恐。搜於國中三曰三夜。
  * "Therefore Zhuang Zi got angry, and searched within the state for three days and three nights"
  * 是に於いて恵子恐れて国中を捜すこと、三日三夜なり。
  * 國 can refer both to the state and the capital
  * [T 於是] [C 惠子恐]
  * [V 搜] 於 [C 國中] [NC 三曰三夜]
    * 於 is locative particle here
    * [M 國 H 中]
      * Within the kingdom
* 莊子往見之，曰，南方有鳥，其名鵷鶵，子知之乎。
  * 荘子往きて之を見て曰く、南方に鳥有り、其の名はエンスウ、子之を知るか。
  * Zhuang Zi went to see him, said, "in the south there is a bird, whose name is the 鵷鶵, do you know of it?"
  * [X 往見之] [Y [V 曰] [O 南方有鳥，其名鵷鶵，子知之乎。]]
    * [T 南方有鳥，其名鵷鶵] [C 子知之乎]
      *  [T 南方有鳥] [C 其名鵷鶵]
* 夫鵷鶵發於南海，而飛於北海，非梧桐不止，非練實不食，非醴泉不飲。
  * 夫のエンスウは南海を発して、北海に飛ぶ。梧桐に非ざれば止まらず、練実（れんじつ）に非ざれば食はず、醴泉に非ざれば飲まず。
  * Zhuang Zi telling Hui Zi about the Yuanchu bird, doesn't even wait for him to answer
  * The Yuanchu flies from the south sea to the north, and only stops at pawlonia, only eats bamboo seeds, and only drinks sweet spring water
  * 夫 is sentence-initial emphatic, like clearing his throat
  * [T 夫鵷鶵發於南海，而飛於北海] [C 非梧桐不止，非練實不食，非醴泉不飲]
    * The comment is about the topic of the behaviour of the bird during the journey
    * 於 is a locative particle here
  * [非梧桐不止，非練實不食，非醴泉不飲] is a bit confusing since they're all the same structure but we can XY binary
    * [X 非梧桐不止] [Y [X 非練實不食] [Y 非醴泉不飲]]
      * [T 非梧桐] [C 不止]
  * Radicals were not stable for pre-qin texts, so 練 could be read 'china berries' if we use the wood radical intead (楝)
    * Commentary:  成去英曰練贲竹貨也。武延緒曰，練棟之借宇
* 於是鴟得腐鼠，鵷鶵過之，仰而視之曰嚇。
  * 是に於いて鴟（し）、腐鼠（ふそ）を得、エンスウ之を過ぐ。仰ぎて之を見て曰く、嚇と。
  * 鴟 is a word for owl (inauspicious animals)
  * 嚇 (hoot, shout)
  * 仰: to look up
  * Thereupon, an owl got ahold of a rotten rat; the yuanchu flies above. The owl looks up towards the yuanchu and hoots.
  * [T 於是] [C 鴟得腐鼠，鵷鶵過之，仰而視之曰嚇]
    * [X 鴟得腐鼠] [Y 鵷鶵過之 ，仰而視之曰嚇]
* 今子欲以子之梁國而嚇我耶。
  * 今子、子の梁国を以って、我を嚇せんと欲するか、と。
  * Are you not hooting at me now, on account of your Kingdom of Liang?
  * 耶 is a leading question particle
  * [T 今] [C 子欲以子之梁國而嚇我耶]
    * [T 子] [C 欲以子之梁國而嚇我耶]
      * [V 欲] [O 以 [X 子之梁國] 而 [Y 嚇我] 耶
        * [V 以] [O 子之梁國]
          * Possessive 之 is to emphasize that Hui Zi thinks that the kingdom is his
        * putting 而 returns '以' to a more concrete meaning: to grasp
        * [V 嚇] [O 我]
  * Commentary: 姚飛曰，記此語者，莊徒之陋。
    * The one who recorded this conversation was a lowly disciple of Zhuang Tu
    * i.e. this passage is vulgar
