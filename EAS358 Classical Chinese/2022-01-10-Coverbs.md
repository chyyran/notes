## Notes
* Coverbs describe an *attendant action*, something done to bring out the action of the *main verb*.
* Being the antecedent condition of the main verb event is possible in all examples of verb coordinations, following verbs are regularly used for this function.

  * 因: to rely on
  * 以: to grasp, to use
  * 為: to act for the sake of
* There are irregularities in how 所 constructions are made
  * In general CV + O\_CV + MV ->  所 + CV + MV, O\_CV 也
    * 以刀殺狗 -> 所以殺狗者, 刀也
* 因 usually takes an object, but by itself at the beginning of a sentence means "relying on the situation recounted in the text above.
* 以X為Y -> to take X to be Y -> 以為 "takes [it] to be..." ("believes that...)
* In V以W, there are two possibilities
  * MV + CV + O\_CV, but the order has been reversed to stress W is the object of 以 
    * V by means of W.
    * 告之以有過 "informed him with the fact of his having erred"
  * V而W "V, and by means of it W"
    * 以 often used to make clear that the first verb is the antecedent of the second.
