  * Cultural context
  * Acrophonic Principle
  * Proto-Sinaitic

  * First Abjads
  * Evolution, spread
* Hebrew
  * structure
  * Matres lectionis, vowel pointing
  * Yiddish
* Precursors to abjads
  * cuneiform
  * phonograms
    * syllabic, consonants, vowels, even coda consonants
  * morphograms
    * whole morephemes, multiple syullables long
* hieroglyphs
  * hieratic, demotic
  * phonograms
  * morphograms
  * phonological, semantic completements that aren't read
  * graphemes could be phonograms or morphograms

* Above relatively conservative cultural centre close to invention of writing
* Abjads rose in a very different cultural centre
* Crossroads
  * west semitic are located between egyptian and east semitic
  * no large empire that ruled this region
  * one side had hieroglyphics, other side cuneiform
  * greater linguistic diversity
  * this area that logograms and determinatives were discarded in favour of purely phonographic writing
  * not a prestigious ancient empire, much greater contatc between people
  * writing not limited to upper classes
  * phonographic systems allows transferability of writing between language with similar phonologies
* akkadian and egyptian both have morphograms and determienrrs
  * semitic abjads do not
  * akkadian represented consonants and vowels
  * egyptian reprsented only consonants
    * semitic abjads only represent consonants.
  * egyptian more likely ancestor
    * foreign words and names often written entirely with monoconsontal graphemes
    * early abjad letterforms may have derived from hieroglyphics
  * purely phonological segemental system is sympler
  * many neighbouring languages also semitic with similar morphological structure
* structure of abjads
  * morphology is sometimes absent in writing!
  * inflectional information recoverable from context
  * cf. English <read>
  * consonants more important factor in identifying lexemes
* acrophony
  * possible source of early semitic graphemes from egyptian morphograms
  * hieroglyph meanings translated into semitic
  * grampheme represented first sound in the translation
  * common in english and other languages
    * english: NATO alphabet

  * another inscriptiopn on the walls of Wadi el Hal
  * very angular, lot of straight lines, carved ons tone
  * some curved graphemes on rock
  * SE Asian scripts very curvy because done on leaves
  * writing surface detemines the look of graphemes
  * becoming more abstract from hieroglyphs
* proto sinaitic/canaanite period lasts 1500-1200 BC
  * south semitic diverges 1400 BC
  * north semitic/phonecian
