## Homework

* nP shells
  * parallel verbal counterparts
    * Hassan's gift of a book to Franny
      Hassan's donation of socks to the shelter
  * identify lexical noun in NP
    * 'gift'
  * three arguments introduced in extended projection
    * complement of N is PP (locative) to Franny
    * specifier of N is PP (theme) (of book, socks)
    * specifier of little-n is EA (Hassan)
  * big N has to move to little-n or ordering is wrong
  * where does 's go?
    * introduced in D?
    * NP hassan introduced in nP, moved up to Spec,DP?
* vP shell structure
  * Examples
    * Hassan put the boxes on the shelves.
    * Hassan shelved the boxes.
    * Hassan boxed the shelves.
  * first 2 sentences have the same meaning!
    * thematic roles are the same
      * agent: Hassan
      * theme: boxes
      * goal: shelves
    * difference is that instead of put we have a verbalization of *shelve*
      * what ends up in the same V as put is *shelve*
      * if we allow the same thing 
### Danish
* Focus on HMC!
 * Head movement constriant (Travis 1984)
    * No \(X^0\) may move past a \(Y^0\) that c-commands it.
    * can't skip over a verb to move to Infl, same for movement to C
    * MUST STOP AT ALL HEADS ALONG THE WAY
* Affirmative root clause
  * Bornen har set denne film
    Bornen har ikke set denne film
    \* Bornen ikke har set denne film
  * finite aux has to be left of negation
  * har *procedes* neg so it must have moved as high as T
    * must have also passed through Agr
    * cant determine if T and Agr are strong or weak, because we need main verb data.
      * auxiliarys can move to both strong or weak positions
  * Given HMC why is it pok to move past Neg?
    * har MUST have moved up to Agr
* Danish V2
  * doesnt really undermine but need to consider CP layer now
  * verb moves to C
  * cant determine if C is strong or weak because auxilliary moves
  * word order requires XP movement to Spec,CP
* embedded clause
  * HAR must follow NEG in embedded clause
  * therefore har is not raising as high as TP
  * cant tell whether har is staying in little-vp or moving to Agr
  * what kind of data do we need to figure out where har goes?
    * we need to see something like adverbial material to show leftedge of little-v
* question 6
  * extra c-later
  * (5) shows V2 in embedded clause -> *har* moves as high as C
  * however in previous question we see that har onlyh moves to Agr
  * seems like *har* has to skip T on route to C
    * what if we omit the T layer altogether?
    * where does the subject go?
    * what if something blocks surfacing in T but Ok to move through it
      * why blocking happens, why is it ok to move through
* HMC
  * prohibits head movement across an intervening head
    * solution for Neg
      * neg forms like *not* and *pas* are actually AdvP in Spec,NegP.
      * head is in a clictic position
        * in french it is *ne*
        * in english it's silent
  * clitics are prosodically weak pronouns
    * always surface adjacent to verbs in romance languages
    * clitics are non-interveners and so can go past HMC
## Case
* inflectional class of verbs determines position
* correlation between inflection and position can be captured by situating inflectional moprphemes in functional structrue, and driving verbs to those positions
* notion of strong and weak positions, correlated with morphological richness
* for verbs that do not move, we briefly talked about lowering to inflect 
* alternative: **feature-checking**
  * verbs come with features that dtermine how their morphological form will look
  * inflecting heads like Agr and T also come with features
  * licensing of inflectional morphology arises by matching and checking relevant features on verb with features on inflecting head **under appropriate conditions**
* **Feature-checking**
  * Let X, Y be terms that carry feature F. F on X can check F on Y just in case:
    * X c-commands Y
    * If X and Y are heads, there is no head Z s.t. X c-commands Z and Z c-commands Y
      * no intervening head
    * An unchecked feature is illegible at the interface
  * feature checking allows inflectional heads like T or Agr to license morphological information of a matching element in its c-command domain
  * A **Target** is the feature F on X that will check F on Y
  * A **Goal** is the term Y with a feature F that matches the target
  * target searches C-command domain and checks the closest match it can
* Weak/strong dichotomody
  * strong/weak distinction i a property of features
    * checking strong F correlates with Move for main V
    * checking weak F correlates with lack of movement
      * deferred to covert movement
    * more to be said for aux V but leave aside for now
  * intuition: something of a cost to movement
    * overtly doing movement is not something you do until you're forced (by strong feature)
* Uniformity reimagined
  * all features trigger movement the same ways
  * languages vary as to overt/coverness of movement (variation)
  * cross-linguistics differences encoded as a property of lexical items
    * reduced to properties of FF bundles
      * strong/weak distinction
* Feature checking can be used to capture case
  * NPs in many language can host case morphology
  * Correlated by syntactic position
    * **Nom**inative case assigned to subjects of finite IPs
    * **Acc**usative case assigned by complements of active V and some prepositions
  * Under GB we posited abstract case to license NPs in positions they are correct
    * formalized by the case filter
      * \*NP if it has phonetic content and no Case
    * accounted for distribution of overt NP
      * where possible = case positions
      * where not possible = caseless
    * raising to subject out of non-finite IP to get case
* abstract case explains
  * Unavailability of over subject in non-finite IP
    * Leo decided [(\*Lina)/Himself] to leave
  * Raising to subject out of non-finite IP
    * Lina seems [t to like her brother]
  * Unavailablity of object in passive
    * Lina was kissed t (by Leo) 
      * \*it was kissed Lina
  * Unavailability of object in unasscusative
    * Jeffrey's bus arrived t
      * needs to front to get case from internal position
  * Ordering of internal arguments
    * Maggie donated [NP her allowance] [to the charity]
    * \*Maggie donated [PP to the charity] [NP her allowance]
      * adjacency requirements, theme is too far away
* Where/when is case assigned?
  * In GB, DPs must be assigned case by a governing verb, preposition, or finite Infl at S-structure
    * Why at SS? Case is relevant at both LF and PF, but not at DS
    * Why not DS? Passive and raising constructions, where DP can't receive case in DS positions
  * Why assigned at SS and not necessarily PF and LF?
    * Case has phonological implications, so it can't be assigned at PF
    * Why not LF? LF cares about case due to the Visibility condition
      * A DP's theta-role is visible at LF only if its case-marked
      * If case-assignment occurs at PF, no theta-role would be visible at LF, and every sentence would violate the theta criterion
    * evidence for visibility condition
      * constrasts such as
        * I met the child [OP_i that Ming believed t_i to be a genius]
        * (13b) \*I met the child [OP_i that it was believed t_i to be a genius]
          * <OP, t> is not overt so should not require case
          * Visibility condition forces a connection between Case and theta
          * (13b) becomes thus a theta-problem
            * not having Case disallows theta-role assignment to lower EA
            * idea is that you need case for proper theta-role assignment at LF
          * we passivied the embedded verb 
* Canonical assignment structure for government was sisterhood
  * Spec-head relations also present
* How was this done in minimalism?
  * Perhaps spec-head relation is canonical, and head-comp relations come for free
  * All case-assignments happen in Spec-head configurations
  * Feature-checking and Move give us this result
  * We need a new AgrP layer for accusative case assignment for this to work
* Traditional GB view
  * Infl is the head responsible for encoding inflection such as tense/aspect/subject agr
* AgrOP
  * Some languages exhibit object agreement as well, so it couldn't have been the whole story
  * Infl is still locus of inflection, but we can decompose AgrP into AgrO and AgrS.
    * AgrS > T > AgrO > vP
      * this structure allows a unified account for case with spec-head relations
* Nominative case
  * T adjoins to AgrS
  * checking of nom-case and subject-agreement occur under a spec-head relation
  * subject moves from vP internal to Spec, AgrSP
    * either EPP or strngth of checked features
  * T + AgrS bundle assigns case to subject
* Accusative
  * *v* moves to AgrO
  * object then checks features with Spec,AgrOP
  * if case feature is strong, object moves to Spec, AgrOP
* case doesn't have to be done overtly, case is checked at LF!
  * we can assume nominative case is overt but accusative is covert in English
  * ex. He saw her
    * covert movement : He her saw, but that's not how we pronounce this because spellout occurs before this movement
* We can extend this to ECM
* Prepositional case
  * in GB, P assigns case to complement DP under a head-comp relation
    * If case-hecking is always under spec-head, same should be true of PP case
    * overt/covert depends on feature strrength
      * In english, this is covert, thus we have prepositions rather than postpositions
    * [AgrP DP_k [Agr' P_i+Agr [PP t_i t_k]]]
  * In Hungarian, prepositions are only possible with Ps that never allow agreement
    * if you dont have movement to AgrP, there is no extra mosphology (overt movement)
