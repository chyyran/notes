# 2022-01-17 Functional Structure

* What functional structure do we need to introduce argument of a predicate?
* external arguments and PISH (predicate internal subject hypothesis)
* Internal arguments and vP shells
* external arguments and vP shells
* unaccusative, unergative intransitive verbs
* internal vs external arguments
  * external arguments: introduced external to the projection of the verb
  * internal argum,ents: introduced internal to projection of the verb
  * **Franny** [VP read *many books*]
    * franny is the external argument
    * [many books] is the internal argument
* standard theory
  * internal arguments introduced within projection V but external argument is introduced outside
* g&b
  * both external and internal arguments are introduced inside the projection of V
    * for a language like english, this is an abstraction, because we know the subject does not surface in VP internal position
    * this is because Franny starts off in SpecVP but moves up to SpecIP for case-checking/epp
      * can easily be shown
        * Franny [VP never studied the chapter]
        * \*Never [VP Franny studied the chapter]
          * bad because we have reasons to say franny starts off, DP needs to move up to get case OR because of EPP
    * cann use position of adjunct for true left edge
    * not a trivial thing in many languages
* Predicate internal subject hypothesis
  * All theta roles associated with head H are assigned within projections of H
  * evidence
    * idiomatic interpretations
      * idiom chunks correspond to syntactic constituents, so idiomaticity can be used as a constituency test
      * find many idioms involving verb and object excluding subject but not ones involving subj and verb excluding object
      * accounted [VP. SU [V' V OB]]
        * can not just pick out the subject and the verb in terms of constituency
      * example
        1. The shit hit the fan
        2. The shit may/should/might/can hit the fan
        3. The shit hit/will hit/is hitting/has hit the fan
        4. The shit did not hit the fan
        5. The shit seemed to hit the fan 
     * all three elements `[the shit] [hit] [the fan]` must be present for the idiomatic interpretation
     * however we're able to preserve the idiomatic interpretation in (2-5)
       * this is unexpected if the structure of the subject and verb is taken as part of the idiom
       * in 6, we have a subordinating predicate 'seem'
     * these are problematic if subject is introduced in infl, but if subject is in SpecVP, that's fine
       * [IP [the shit_1] [I' may/should/might...] [VP t_1 [V' hit the fan ]]]
     * idioms can be larger than VP, and we can not change the material within those structures
       1. A rolling stone gathers no moss (expands beyodn VP)
          * #A rolling stone gathered/might gather/is gathering no moss
          * #A rolling stone seemed to gather no moss.
       2. Is the Pope catholic? (built up in CP!)
          * #Was the Pope catholic?
          * #Mary wonders whether the Pope is catholic.
    * coordinate subject extraction
      * extraction out of a single conjunct is not permitted 
      * extraction from all conjuncts in so-called ATB movement is permissible
      * example
        * \*[CP what_i did [IP John eat t_i] and [IP Bill cook hamburgers]]
        * [CP what_i did [IP John eat t_i] and [IP Bill cook t_i ]]
      * same thing is extracted out of both conjuncts
      * now consider the following ATB-extraction
        1. The girls will [write a book] and [be awarded a prize for it]
        2. [IP [the girls]_i will [[VP write a book] and [VP be awarded t_i a prize for it] ]]
          * second [ VP ] is passive, DP that ends up in subject position originates as internal argument predicate
          * [the girls] is the recipient of the verb award, e.g. Franny awarded [the girls] a prize (as complement)
        3. [IP [the girls]_i will [VP t_i write a book] and [VP be awarded t_i a prize for it]]
           * If we introduce the external argument in Infl then there is no relation between the first and second VP 
    * binding
    * floating quantifiers
