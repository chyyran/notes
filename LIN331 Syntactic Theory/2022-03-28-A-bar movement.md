# 2022-03-28 A-bar movement

* A movement
  * movement to AgrO to check [uACC], movement to AgrS+T for [uNOM], etc.
  * always from a caseless position to a core argument position
  * associated with subjecthood or objecthood
  * phrasal movement to an Infl head
* A-bar movement
  * movement to a position higher than Infl
  * case to the edge of a clause: Spec,CP
  * always from a Case position
  * three main environments
    * questions (interrogatives)
    * relative clauses
    * focus constructions
  * has three properties
    * leaves a gap
    * unbounded
    * subject to island restrictions
* Question environments
  1. Gapping: gap represents whatever position the moved expression got case
    * **What** did Franny read __ for class?
    * **Who** did Franny say [__ was late for dinner]?
       * subject of embedded clause
    * [For **what** reason] did Franny sell her car __?
      * pied piping
        * **what** 'drags' out For and reason
        * adjunct that has been dragged out (where Because clause wiuld be)
    * Franny wondered [**who** she would see __ at the party]
      * can be fronted to CP of an embedded clause
  2.  unboundedness
    * **Who** did Franny say [that Hassan saw __]
    * **Who** did F. say [that G believed [that H. saw __]]
    * **Who** did F. say [that G belueved [that the journalist reported [that H. saw __]]]
  3. Relative clayses
    * The people [**who** Franny met__]
    * The people [**who** __ met Franny]
    * The people [**why** Franny didn't meet the people ___]
    * The people [**who** F. said [G. believed [the journalist reported [that H. saw __]]]
* Focus constructions (it clefts)
  * Frame: EXPL BE [Focus Phrase] [associated clause with gap]
    * focusing corresponds with presentation of new information
  * It is **Franny** [that I saw __ at the store]
  * It is **neighbours** [that _ complained about the noise]
  * It is **because she was tired** [that Franny left early __]
  * It is **Franny** [that Hassan said [that G. saw __]]
* A lot of number of clefts and not a lot of agreement on the structure of clefts
* Oter languages uses focus movement instead of it-cleft
  * focused element is just fronted to the left edge
* Long distance focus movement
* We will refer to expressions that move as wh-movement
* Islands
  * A-bar movement can unbounded but there are several constructions that block A-bar movement
  * focus phrases are trapped within island domain
  * some can be understood as intervention effects from locality restrictions on feature-checking
  * A-bar movement as feature checking triggered by uninterpretable feature on clause-edge projection C.
    * C has [uWh] or [uFoc] which checks corresponding feature on a goal phrase
  * embedded clauses are not normally islands but **embedded quesitons** are islands
    * you can not move a wh-phrase out of an embedded question
      1. When did Franny say [they left here __]?
      2. \*When did Franny say [how they left here __ __]?
        * cf. Franny said [they left here yesterday by bus]
      3. When did F. say __ [how they left here __]? 
  * we can plausibly understand wh-islands to fall out of the impementation of FC we have been working with
    * [uWh] on embedded C checks [Wh] that it c-commands
    * [uWh] on matrix C can not check embedded [Wh], checks matrix [Wh] instead (locality restrictions)
  * not all islands can be reduced this way with an intervening [Wh]

* Coordinate structures
  * cannot move a phrase out of just one conjunct
    * \*Which book did Franny read this review and skim __?
      * cf. Franny read this review and skimmed the book
    * \*Who did Franny visit __ and her mother?
      * cf. Franny visited her sister and her mother
* Adjunct islands
  * adjunct clauses are islands for A-bar movement
    * \*Which pasta did Franny choose this wine [because she ordered ___]?
      * cf. Franny chose this win ebecause she ordered that pasta
    * \*Who did Franny call her mother [after she saw __]?
      * cf. Franny called her mother after she saw the doctor
* Subject islands
  * subject clauses are islands for A-bar movement
    * \*Which guest did [that Franny invited __] surprise us?
      * cf. [CP That Franny invited that guest] surpised us. 
* Complex NPs
  * NPs modified by relative causes are islands
    * What dod Franny met [the person [who wrote __]]?
    * cf. Franny met [the person [who wrote the bylaws]]
* examples
  * \*What is that she doesn't like surprising
    * That she doesn't like [what/pasta] is surprising
    * subject island
  * \*Where did you have short hair when you lived in?
    * You had short hair [when you lived in [where/Montreal]]?
    * we don't interpret the subordinate clause as a question (embedded question island?)
    * adjunct clause island
  * \*Who did Maya and finish their homework?
    * Did Maya and [who/Frany] finish their homework?
    * coordinate island
  * \*What is she vegetarian because she doesn't like the taste of ?
    * adjunct clause island
    * Is she vegetarian [because she doesn't like the taste of [what/meat]]?
* subjacency
  * in GB, one explanation was concept of subjacency
  * measure of structural distance between two nodes in a tree and therefore distance crossed by movement
  * certian nodes where designated 'bounding nodes'
  * a trace must be 1-subadjacent to its closest antecedent in a chain 
    * movement can not cross more than 1 bounding node
* phase
  * a phase is a syntactic domain defined as the complement of designated heads (C, v)
  * domain within which all features must be checked
  * once a phase is complete, it is spelled out and becomes opaque to subsequent steps in the syntactic derivation
## Huang 1982
* Even if its not overt, languages have covert A-bar movement
  * Chinese
    ```
    ni  xihuan shei?
    you like   who
    who do you like
    ```
    should be analyzed in LF as [shei_i [ni xihuan e_i]]
* Examined 2 types of A-bar phenomenon in Chinese
  * focus clefting
  * wh-movement
* starting point is the scope puzzle
  4. Zhangsan asked me who bought books
    ```
    [Zhangsan wen wo [shei mai-le shu]]
              ask me  who  buy.PST books
    ```
     * Matrix verb requires interrogative complement and scope of the wh-expression *shei* is the embedded clause (indirect question)
  5. Who does Zhangsan believe bought books
    ```
    [Zhangsan xiangxin [shei mai-le shu]]
              believe  who  buy.PST books
    ```
    * In (5), the matrix verb requires a declarative complement and scope of *shei* is the matrix clause (**direct question**)
  6. Matrix verb *zhidao* can select eiether declarative or interrogative complement and scope of *shei* can be the embedded or matrix clause
    ```
    [Zhangshan zhidao [shei mai-le shu]]
               know    who  buy.PST books
    ```  
    1. Who does Zhangsan know bought books?
    2. Zhangsan knows who bought books
* Given the parallelism between the interpretations and what is seen in corresponding environments with overt A-bar movement, Huang suggests it is natural to posit abstract LF representations with A-bar movement
* In other words, sentences like the above involves
  * a quantifier (wh-expression)
  * an empty category (gap)
  * movement process
* Cleft sentences
  * focus interpretations
  * Focus marker like *shi* æ˜¯ immediately precedes the element that is focused
    * no movement is observable but the sentence is split into a focus and a presupposition
  1. It is I [that wants to buy the book tomorrow]
    ```
    shi wo [mingtian yao  mai  neiben  shu]
    FM  F  tmrw      want buy  that.CL book
    ```
  2. It is tomorrow that I want to buy the book
     ```
     wo shi mingtian [yao  mai nenben  shu] 
     I  FM  tmrw      want buy that.CL book
     ```
  3. I do want to buy that book tomorrow
     ```
     wo mingtian shi [yao  mai nenben  shu] 
     I  tmrw     FM   want buy that.CL book
     ```
  * Huang proposes that the focused element in the cleft sentence as a quasi-quantifier (wh-expr) binding a variable in the presupposition via covert movement
* this allows for an explanation of the that that a wh-question like 6 is ambiguous
  * having interpretations with embedded scope and matrix scope for wh-quantifier, so too can cleft sentences be ambiguous
    * Zhangsan said that is is tomorrow that Lisi will come/It is tomorrow that Zhangsan said that Lisi will come
     ```
      Zhangsan shuo [Lisi shi mingtian lai]
               say        FM  tomorrow come
     ```
    * Speaker emphasis vs matrix subject emphasis
    * Speaker emphasis:
      * embedded clause = indirect speech
      * focus movement is to matrix CP
      * [FM tomorrow\_x] [Zhangsan said that Lisi x will come]
    * Matrix subject emphasis
      * embedded clause = direct quote
      * Focus movement is to embedded CP
      * Zhangsan said that it is tomorrow that Lisi will come
      * [Zhangsan said that [FM tomorrow_x [Lisi x will come]]]
  * When we have identical surface strings, we posit different underlying representations
  * Bulk of the evedence comes from island effects
    * complex NP islands
    * subject clause islands
  * evidence from islands that the proceses involved (DE marks internall headed relative clause)
    * clause modifies a nominal internal to it
    * Ungrammatical: \*I like the dog that is Zhangsan that bought
      ```
      *[wo xihuan [shi Zhangsan mai de neishi    gou]]
        I  like    FM           buy DE that.CL   dog
      ``` 
    * \*The book that it was yesterday that Zhangsan bought is very good.
      ```
      *[[Zhangsan shi zuotian   mai de neiben  shu ] hen  hao]
                  FM  yesterday buy DE that.CL book  very good
      ``` 
      Complex NP island
    * \*That it is tomorrow that Zhangsan will come doe snot matter
      ```
      *[[Zhangsan shi mingtian lai] mei guanxi]
                  FM  tmrw     come no  matter
      ``` 
    * Focus in these sentences can not be intepreted as indicating the emphasis of a matrix subject
    * it can not be interpreted as tho there is a gap in the embedded clause
    * cover movement analysis correctly predicts
      * the unavailability of double cleft structures
        * two focused elements can not relate to a single CP
      * the existance of focus islands
        * focus movement out of an embedded focus domain is prohibitied
        * once you create a focus you can't make another one and shift it to the matrix clause
    * embedded question also triggers a focus island
  * story is more complicated
    * Wh-expressions in some compex NPs are ok
    * [shei yao mai de] shu zui gui? / \*Books that who wants to buy are most expensive
    * seems bad cases above can be explained by an independent restriction on wh-quantifiers inside specific Ds having scope outside of the D
