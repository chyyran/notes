## Homework
* Question 1
  * Warmup
  * V feature triggers search for V. 
    * AgrO has V feature
    * little-v has V feature
* Does checking happen under spec-head, or c-command? When does it happen?

* Icelandic
  * [ACC] is licensed by AgrO of active, transitive V
  * [NOM] licensed by finite Infl
  * DPs must get case
  * Icelandic noun phrases are morphologically marked for case
  * Subjects are nominative, objects are accusative
  * (2). ACC case on subject of subordinate clause
    * Non-finite clauses in English can not assign nominative case
    * What is surprising is that [Jon] is accusative
    * The same pattern in (2b) is not grammatical as in (2a)
    * This tells us that the verb 'believe' is somehow special where subordinate NF clauses can get accusative case
      * Special accusative case becomes available when believe subordinates a clause
      * maybe there is a barrier, maybe it is comes from the case available lexically
  * (3) When we passivize, then Maria gets NOM, not ACC
    * Passive does not have case to assign
    * No AgrO = no Acc case
    * external argument (Jon) gets demoted
    * Nominative case on finite T can 'rescue' Mary
    * clauses need subjects, and if we move it to subject position, itll get subject case
    * (b) tells us there is no accusative case in the structure
      * putting an expletive means Maria no longer fronts
      * if there was a free accusative case, then Maria would have taken it but it is ungrammatical in its base position
      * can't get nominative because EXPL is taking it.
  * (4) BELIEVE has been passivized, so Mary (Obj) fronts, but it is the subject of the embedded clause
    * Mary gets NOM instead of expected ACC (which we assumed in (2a) that BELIEVE gets ACC)
    * believed is passivized, so no ACC case to give
    * Jon gets case from KISSED
    * if we keep Mary low, it's ungrammatical in (4b)
    * passivization deletes case regardless of any special-case assignment
* Icelandic Quirky Case
  * How does Quirky Case impact the following observations?
    * NOM on NP checked by FIN AgrS+T
    * [NOM] NP has NOM morphology
    * ACC on NP checked by AgrO
    * [ACC] NP has ACC morphology
  * (5) shows quirky case patterns
  * (6) is what happens when a verb that assigns quirky case is embedded under a non-finite clause
    * We see special morphological cases on their subjects
    * looks like under believes subject of a non-finite clause is grammatical even without subject case on subordinate Infl
    * is there another possibility that they could be getting case a different way?
      * perhaps non-finite T can license case other than NOM?
      * special case that the verb has to give is the thing that satisfies case filter?
        * (7) disproves this because under a CP-embedding verb, it is no longer possible to license them
        * under passive, AgrO disappears and the specially marked objects have to front, but retain their quirky case
        * if they can not get case from finite infl, then its ungrammatical
  * last set of examples lead us to the same solution
    * if you passivize BELIEVE, it can no longer license under AgrO accusative, so the subordinate subject has to front to matrix T
    * if there is an expletive there, then it is ungrammatical
  * the relationship between ACC and NOM checking and its morphology is questioned
    * if it has quirky case, then it bears quirky case
    * DPs have to be checked in NOM-ACC relations regardless
    * not questioning actual structural case, but only relationship between structural and morphological case
    * NOMs need structural case even if they have quirky case
    * quirky DPs must still have a NOM or ACC feature checked by finite AgrS+T or AgrO
