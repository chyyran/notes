# 2022-02-14 Subject Positions

* Point of variation across languages
  * SV(O) (Icelandic) vs Expletive VS(O)
  * Expl. VSO: there read some students the book
    * where there's an expletive in subject position, you get VSO, but otherwise you get SVO.
  * SVO: some students read the book
* Spanish and greek you get contrast with inversion pattenrs
  * Juan read the book (SVO) / Read Juan the book (VSO)
  * Peter married Elektra/Married Peter Elektra
* Agreemnt constrast in arabic
  * SVO order requires agreement in arabic
* Languages where you only get SVO if subject is topicalized, default is VSO (irish)
* What does VS word order tell us about EPP?
* Locus of EPP is Strong[D*] feature on AgrS
  * Strong D feature is strong, and overly moves to SpecAgrSP
* What does VS word order tell us about EPP?
  * Could it be that VS order either lack EPP or have a weak EPP feature
  * Hypothesis A
    * VSO allowance => Weak [D], or No [D], therefore no XP merges overtly in Spec,AgrSP
    * rejected by A&A
  * Things can merge directly or as a result of movement
* Move reduces to COPY + Merge (Internal merge)
* Something has to merge with SpecAgrSP with strong D feature
* For A&A, EPP in VS order is **strong** but being satisfied differently
  * X^0 can satisfy EPP, rather than Merge(XP)
    * X^0 = inflected V of null subject languages have the D feature
    * NSLs are languages that allow an independent (finite) clause to lack an overt subject
  * Agreement morphology in NSL has the same **formal features** as pronouns in other languages
    * an explanation for how languages can have null subjects
    * correspondence to morphological richness is metaphorical, but it really is a richness in the abstract FF structure
  * unified account of SVO/VSO alternations
    * New theory of EPP
* Patterns to account for 
  * Some languages (not all) have overt expletives in VSO orders (i.e Germanic)
  * Some language shave definiteness restriction on subjects in VS order (i.e. Germanic)
  * Some languages have VP internal subjects in VSO order (English, Greek)
  * Some languages have transivitiy restriction in VS orders (English)
* Languages split into two major types
  * Those that project Spec,AgrSP, and those that do not.
  * Expl-VSO: AgrSP is projected, and EPP satisfied by Merge XP
  * VSO: No AgrSP spec, EPP satisfied by Merge X^0
  * property of being able to specify EPP with verb goes hand-in-hand with null-subj languages
* famous observation about NSLs
  * Null subjects correspond with free inversion (i.e. VS word order)
  * Could it be that Spec,AgrSP is always available but contains a null expletive?
  * A&A argue against this on the grounds of definiteness restriction
    * restriction against strong universally quantified DPs cannot be subject in VS order
      * There arrived a child
      * \*There arrived **each child**
* What determines whether a language has DR effects?
  * Chomsky:
    * Expletives have D features, so they require an NP complement/associate
      * associate: erstwhile subject in an expletive structure
    * Follows that NP associate is nonspecific
  * A&A:
    * Since NSL lack expletives, then subjects are **not associates** with [D], so no DR arises.
* How then, can we get SVO without AgrSP?
  * subjects in SVO are **left-dislocates**, or A-bar topics
  * left-dislocation are based-generted high (adjoiend at left edge of clause) and coindexed with a pronoun in vP.
  * ajoined someone above AgrS and related to a pronoun in argument position
    * contrasts with base-generated as argument internal to vP
    * distributional evidence
      * adverbial material an intervene between S and V in NSLs, cf. non-nsl like French
      * subjects in greek can precede complementizers!
        * because Peter if Mary FUT leave -> Because if Mary comes, Peter will leave
      * scope interpretations
        * normally scope properties that a quantifier has on the basis of pre-movement position are preserved when moved to an A-position.
        * In Greek, the scopal properties of the subject do not get preserved preceeding the verb
          * preverbal subjects occasionally force nonsensical interpretation whereas ambiguous postverbal positions are fine.
      * Montalbetti effects: an overt subject pronoun in NSLs cannot be understood as a bound variable]
        * occur in SV orders but not in VS orders
      * manner adverbs are what marks the left edge of vp
