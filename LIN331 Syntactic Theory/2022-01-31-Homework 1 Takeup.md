>
> (1)  *The teacher seemed the students to do their homework.
> 
> (2)   The students seemed to have done their homework. 
> 
> A. Explain, to the best of your knowledge, why sentence (1) is ruled out,  You can make use of whatever background in syntactic theory you are bringing into this course, but be please explain your assumptions.
> 
> B. Contrast sentence (1) with sentence (2), showing how sentence (2) doesnâ€™t violate whatever it was that ruled out sentence (1).

* (1) ruled out by theta criterion and case filter
  * Theta criterion
    * matrix subject [the teacher] does not get a theta role.
    * [seem] is an unaccusative and thus can not assign role
    * [seem] only has an IA-role to assign to [the students to do their homework]
    * [the students] does not get case because because embedded clause is non-finite, and non-finite T can not license case.
* (2) grammatical because [the students] raises-to-subject, and gets case from [done]
  * [seemed] allows subject position to be occupied by lower argument
