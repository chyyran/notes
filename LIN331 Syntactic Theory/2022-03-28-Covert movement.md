# 2022-03-28 Covert movement

* Why is movement sometimes overt and sometimes covert?
* one answer is **Procrastinate**
  * covert movement is more economical than overt movement
  * effect of this is that overt movement wont apply unless forced by strong feature
* core premise is that syntax before and after spellout is uniform containing of same principles and operations
* covert and overt movement seem to be fundamentally different
  * overt movement is cyclic
    * order of operations is determined by the order of structure building
    * obeys the extension condition
      * **extension condition**: overt applications of Merge can only target root syntactic objects
    * covert movement doesn't look cyclic not follow extension condition
    * with these differences we can challenge the presmise that syntax before and after is uniform BUT
      * alternative implementation of covert movement: MoveF
        * covert movement is formal feature movement, leaving behind phonological and semantic features of a lexical item
        * can happen at the same time before spellout as overt movement
    * conceptuial motivation for Move F
      * what triggers movement operations in the first place
        * if deactivation of uF is the trigger for movement then minimalist considerations might lead us to expect movement to operate just on FF rather than whole lexical phrasal categories
        * we may expect covert movement to be the optimal movement
        * properties of PF that requires material to pied-pipe phonological features with overt movement
