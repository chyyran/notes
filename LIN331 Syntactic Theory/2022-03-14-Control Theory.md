# 2022-03-14 Control Theory

* Recall
  * non-finite AgrS does not have [uNOM] and can not license case of its subject
  * raising verb like *seem* can rescue the subject of a subordinated non-finite clause
  * seems that the non-finite subordinate clause has a missing subject understood as the same as the matrix subject
  * relation between matrix and missing subject is understood in terms of movement
  * ex: Franny/she seems [t to be late]
* control verbs
  * subject raising verbs not alone in taking non-finite complements with missing subject
  * Franny { attempted, decided, hoped, tried } [to sing opera]
  * fundamental difference
    * in raising structures we see a single argument that seem to be assoc. with 2 syntactic positions but not with two semantic roles
      * this is represented as movement
      * Franny seems [t to be late]
    * in control structures we see a single argument that seems to be associated with two syntactic positions, and two syntactic roles.
      * represented as a referential dependency with null-category PRO
      * Franny hopes [PRO to sing opera]
      * it looks like the relation between [Franny] and [PRO] is almost like a binding relation
    * control verbs impose selectional requirements on subjects
      * The street seemed to come alive at night (raising)
      * \*The street hoped to come alive at night (control)
        * hope requires an agentive subject
    * selectional requirements imposed by the control verb is distinct from requirements on the lower clause
      * \*Franny hoped to elapse
      * \*Time hoped to elapse
    * raising verbs can have expletive subjects, control verbs can not
      * It seemed that Franny was late (raising)
      * \*It hoped that Franny sang opera (control)
    * idiom chunks
      * raised DP can be intepreted as an idiom chunk in the subordiate clause, but not for a control clause
      * [The cat seemed] t to be out of the bag]] *raising*
      * \*[The cat hopes] to be out of the bag]
    * scope recostruction
      * (landau p. 12)
      * interpretation of quantified DP
        * Seven civilians are likely to starve to death this weekend (raising)
          * scope: DP >> pred (specific 7 civvies will starve), scope 2: pred >> DP (likely that 7 civvies will starve but no specific people)
            * [seven civilians] exists both since trace is below
        * Seven civilians are afraid to starve to death this weekend (control)
          * [seven civilians] does not have the representation below
          * understood to mean 7 specific people
    * equivalence under passive
      * In raising structures, subordinate clause can be passivized with no effect on truth conditions
        * A specialist examined Franny
        * Franny was examined by a specialist
      * Raisnig
        * A specialized seemed to have examined Franny
        * Franny seemed to have been examined by a specialist
      * Control
        * A specialist intends to examine Franny
          * specialist has intetion
        * Franny intends to be examined by a specialist
          * frany has intention
* Subject vs object control
  * Subject control: the missing subject (PRO) is controlled by the subject of the matrix clause
  * other matrix arguments can be controllers
  * which one it is depends on the control verb
  * some verbs allow object control
    * persuade, enourage, recommend, appeal, force, please, order, urge, dissuade
  * Franny persuaded Hassan [PRO to sing opera]
  * looks very superficially similar to ECM structures
