* Subfields
  * Articulatory phonetics
    * speech production
  * Acoustic phonetics
    * speech sounds
  * Auditory phonetics
    * speech perception

* IPA
  * One symbol <=> one sound
  
* Goals
  * articulation, and acoustics of speech sounds (consonants, vowels, and prosody)
  * Identity, phoentically transcribe, and **produce** a wide range of speech sounds and prosodic patterns
  * understand experimental methods used in research. 

* vocal articulator
  * upper (pasive) articulators
    * upper lip
    * teeth
    * alveolar ridge
    * hard palate
    * velum
  * lower (active)
    * lower lip
    * tongue tip
    * blade
    * front
    * back
* antiformants
  * traps for certain frequencies of sound
  * nasalized vowel due to some closure of articulator
* vowels 
  * air flows freely through the oral cvity
  * no major obstruction in the vocal tract
  * described in two dimensions
    * height/backness
  * also described via rounding
    * [u] rounded, [i] unrounded
* consonants
  * some constriction in the vocal tract
  * some obstruction of flow
  * can be slight or large constriction
  * described in three dimensions
    * voicing
    * place of articulation (where in vocal tract)
      * biliable (lips)
      * labiodental (lower lips + upper teeth)\
      * dental (tongue tip + teeth)
      * alveolar (tongue tip + alveolar ridge)
      * postalveolar (tongue blade + post alveolar palate)
      * retroflex (back tip of tongue + alveolar ridge)
      * palatal (back of tongue to hard palate)
      * velar ()  
    * manner (how is the airstream constricted)
      * stops
        * [p b t d k g ?] (english)
      * fricatives
        * narrow opening, causing turbulence
        * "noisy" fricatives are sibilants
        * [f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ h]
      * affricates
        * slow release of a complete closure
        * [t͡ʃ d͡ʒ]
      * approximants
        * liquids, laterals, glides
        * consonants with greater opening in vocal tract than fricatives
          * [(w) l j ɹ ]
          * [j w] are glides, [l ɹ] are liquids
      * nasals
        * full closure in oral cavity, unobstructued
* laterals (/l/)
  * most sounds are central 
    * constriction is evenly distributed across tongue
    * laterals are sounds made with a closure at the centre of the tongue, but an opening at the sides of the tongue
    * air can freely flow around the tongue in order to escape out the sides of the mouth
* english approximants
  * bunched ɹ
  * retroflex ɻ
  * acoustically the same
  * r-like sounds are rhotics
  * liquids are both laterals and rhotics
* glides
  * rapidly articulated vowel-like sound
    * [j] corresponds to [i]
      * palatal
    * [w] corresponds to [u]
      * labial-velar
      * some English speakers have a voiceless [ʍ] /hw/
* nasals
  * sounds made with complete constriction in oral cavity and velic opening that allows air to flow freely through nasal passage
  * [m n ŋ]
