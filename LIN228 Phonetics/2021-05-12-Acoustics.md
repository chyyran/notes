## Tutorial

* Convention is to write the lax vowel before an /r/, no tense lax distinction
* Only stressed syllables get length markings
  * Tense Vowels: /i ej aj aw u ow ɑ ɔj ɔ/
  * Lax Vowels: /ɪ ε æ ʌ ʊ ə/
  * **Only tense vowels get inherent length**
  * Before a voiced consonant or in syllable-final position, vowels are lengthened.
* Things to focus on when looking at narrow transcription
  * vowel length
  * nasalization
  * Canadian raising
  * aspiration
  * rounding
  * tapping
  * fronting
  * velarization
  * syllabified consonants
  * dentalization
  * yod coalescence
  * devoicing
  * retroflexion

## Instrumental Methodologies

* Traditional Palatography
  * cf. Electropalatography
  * very low tech
  * powdered charcoal, olive oil, paintbrush, and mirror
  * mix up charcoal and olive oil to create a paint
  * paint the tongue with charcoal mixture
  * subject says a word where the tongue only makes contact **once**
  * charcoal sticks to top of the palate
  * put the mirror at an angle in the mouth and take a picture
  * drawbacks
    * **very slow**
    * only one sound at a time
    * can easily smear paint or swallow
  * advantages
    * low tech
    * cheap
  * linguagraphy
    * paint palate, and see paint distribution on the tongue
* Xray
  * XRAY to get images of the vocal tract
  * present the trace drawings, not the raw X-ray images
  * sagittal sections
  * drawbacks
    * radiation risk
    * lot of experience to interpret x-ray photographs
* Ultrasound
  * saggital or coronal (front)
  * stick ultrasound wand up under the mouth
  * can see tongue from different directions
  * advantages
    * not invasive
    * relatively inexpensive (couple hundred dollars)
    * used in speech therapy because of low cost
  * disadvantages
    * cant see lips, teeth
    * harder to interpret at first
* MRI
  * advantages
    * resulting images are much more clearer
  * disadvantages
    * slower
    * difficult to get moving pictures
    * expensive

## Acoustics
* Want to to be able to describe acoustics of speech
  * explanation for why sounds get confused for other sounds
  * certain details not explainable if only articulation considered
  * vowels better described acoustically
  * vital information for speech recognition and synthesis
  * insight into sound perception
  * audio data is easiest to obtain
* Waveform
  * display of a sound wave
  * fluctuations in **amplitude** over time
  * travelling **pressure fluctuation** that propagates through a medium
    * in speech it is air
  * wave fluctuates with time with peaks of *rarefaction* and *compression*
  * fluctuations impining on eardrum produce sensation of sound
  * fluctuations are often cyclic and repetitive.
* Propagation
  * line up to buy tickets analogy
  * rarefaction is a dip in the waveform
    * lower pressure
  * compression is a peak
    * higher pressure
* Simple periodic waves
  * waveform of the pressure variation has the same shape as that of the movement of an air mlecure
  * pure tones appear as sine waves when represented as a waveform
* Amplitude and intensity are physical properties that correlate with the **psychological property** of loudness
  * the greater the amplitude, the louder the sound
  * the greater the intensity, the louder the sound
* Amplitude is the degree of variation in air pressure from neutral to lower (hPA)
  * difference of change in pressure
* Intensity is the power transmitted by the wave in dB
  * 0dB- threshold of audibility
  * 30dB - whispered conversation
  * 60dB normal conversation
  * 110dB rock concert
  * 120dB pain threshold
* Frequency
  * number of cycles per second (Hz)
  * physical property
  * correlates with pitch (psychological property)
  * 20kHz - highest perceptible
  * 265Hz - child speech
  * 225Hz - feminine speech
  * 120Hz - masculine speech
  * 20Hz - lowest perceptible
* Complex repetitive waves
  * speech sounds are more like this
  * need fourier analysis to split into pure sine waves
  * human ear is believed to perform a fourier-like analysis
* Harmonics
  * individial component waves of a complex wave
  * **Fundamental frequency (F0)** is the lowest harmonic of a complex wave
  * All harmonics above have frequencies that are a multiple of the fundamental
  * **harmonics are affected by the F0**
    * F0 is created by vibration of the vocal folds, and whether its a male or female voice
  * the lower the F0, the less distance between harmonics
  * the higher the F0, the more distance between harmonics
  * F0 changes by **changing pitch**
  * harmonics are created by the glottis
* A **spectrum** is a display that shows the amplitude or intensity of each harmonic 
  * frequency domain visualization, cf. time-domain visualization of a wave
* Resonance
  * natural tendency of a body to vibrate at certain frequencies
  * vocal tract properties can change as we change the shape of the vocal tract
  * some frequencies are amplified (reinforced), some are filtered out.
* Formants
  * clusters of harmonics that are resonating (reinforced) by the vocal tract
  * the shape of the vocal tract determines the formants
    * **formants change depending on the vowel**
    * changing the vowel changes the shape of the filter
    * actual spacing of the harmonics don't change
  * F1 (lowest formant) is determined by the resonating frequency of the **back cavity**
    * area behind where the tongue is the highest
    * corresponds to vowel backness
  * F2 is determined by the resonating frequency of the **front cavity**
    * area in front of where the tongue is the highest
    * corresponds to vowel height
  * F1 and F2 give us the most information for distinguishing vowels
  * F1/F2 not multiples of F0 (fundamental frequency)
  * vocal tract shape determines resonance and creates the formants
  * Low vowels have a higher frequency F1
  * High vowels have a low frequency F1
  * Front vowels have higher F2
  * Back vowels have lower F2
* Noise
  * waves that are aperiodic 
  * random fluctuations of amplitude
  * fricatives have aperiodic noise
  * many sounds are combinations of periodic and aperiodic waves
  * voiceless fricative has **only noise**
  * voiced fricative has a glottal pulse, so it has both periodic and aperiodic waves
