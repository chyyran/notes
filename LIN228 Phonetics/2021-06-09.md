## Homework 3 Q13
* approx frequency of formants of Omar (F0 105Hz) and Lila (F0 210Hz)
  * approx the same assuming same or similar vocal tract size as omar 
  * f0 has no relationship with formants
* source filter theory
  * filter + source required to make speech
  * don't have any relationship between each other
  * source = glottis
    * F0 and harmonics
    * harmonics = n*F0
  * filter = vocal tract above vocal folds
    * resonant frequencies
    * formants
    * height, backness
* harmonics bunch up where formants are
* formants further apart smaller the filter
* no harmonic to be amplified does not mean there is no formant
  * filter is still the same
  * filter doesn't notice
* human F0 only falls within a small range of frequencies
### Homework 5, Q13
* CSI TV Show 
* range of formants
* f0 not based on height
  * thickness of the vocal folds
* formants roughly correlated with height
* children of diff sex do not diff f0
* proportionally small vocal tract
* schwa is best way to calculate vocal tract length
* don't care about pitch
