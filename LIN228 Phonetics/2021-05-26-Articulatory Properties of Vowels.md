# 2021-05-26 Articulatory Properties of Vowels

* English has more vowels than most languages
* wals.info world atlas of language structures
  * articulartory descriptions of vowels use 
    * height
    * backness
    * roudning
    * 
* vowels are often better described by position of formants
  * relative position of GA vowels does not resemble traditional vowelspace
  * somewhat right but intuitions were more based on acoustics
  * acoustic measurement of F1 and F2 has a better match to traditional vowelspace
* cardinal vowels were designed to provuide reference points in vowelspace
  * vowels are described in refeerence to cardinal space
  * produced at the extreme periphery of vowel space and are equidistant from one another
  * center line divides space in terms of backeness
  * two horizontal lines divide the space in terms of height
  * front and back set of vowels are equidistance
  * schwa is always at the center 
* teach phonetics student cardinal vowels and compare with pronunciations to closest cardinal vowel
* primary aan secondary sets for cardinal vowels
  * low back vowel is more often unrounded crosslinguistically 
  * unrounded goes to the left, rounded goes to the right
  * secondary are primary vowels with opposite rounding, most are 
* primary vowels are more common than secondary vowels
* lip rounding for back vowels tend to be made for protuding lips
* lip rounding for front vowels tend to be made by narrowing lips without pushing them forward
* vowel systems are generally transcribed using the cardinalv vowel that is closest to each vowel in a language
* even when vowel syustems of two langauges are the same, the average articulation may be different
* Formats
  * Back cavity large: low F1
  * Back cavity small: High F1
  * front cavity large: low F2
  * Front cavity small: high f2
  * adding lip rounding **lowers** F2 because enlarges front cavity 
  * low back rounded vowel has the lowest F2 and highest F1
* Sometimes there are not enough cardinal vowels
  * if language has 5 unrounded front vowels, there will not be enough cardinal vowels to describe a language
  * additional symbols
    * [ɪ] between [i] and [e]
    * [ʏ] between [y] and [ø]
    * [ʊ] between [u] and [o]
    * [æ] between [ɛ] and [a]
    * [ɐ] - high low central unrounded
  * english has three phonemic low unrounded vowels
    * this is why low front vowel is transcribed [æ] and not [a]
  * if more precision is needed we can mark with IPA symbols like [æ̝] for ash raising
* rhoticization
  * causes lowering of F3
  * rhoticized by curing back the tongue tip or retracting the tip
  * hollowing of tongue body
* half rhoticization
  * marked with one rhotic mark
  * full rhoticization marked with 2
* nasalization
  * english vowels nasalized allophonically
  * some languages are constrastively 
  * indicated with a tilde
  * french has a lot of contrastive nasalization
* expansion
  * contrast between vowels made with expanded and nonexpanded pharynx
  * tongue root is pulled forward in expanded and larynx is lowered
  * non expanded set is pronounced with tongue back without lowered larynx
  * also termed ATR and RTR (advanced/retracted ongue root)
  * e̘ advanced
  * e̙ retracted
  * expanded vowels have lower F1 since pharyngeal cavity is larger
* tense-lax may be relevant for others
  * sometimes they use ATR/RTR symbols but not the same
  * for most part you dont get larger pharyngeal cavity when articulating english lax vowels
* length
  * length distinction present in some languages
  * vowel length is not contrastive in english
  * contrastive in some languages
* any vowel symbol can be made to represent a glide using subscript arch e̯
  * french has 3 glides
## Airstream mechanisms
* all articulation depends on manipulating flow of air across articulators in vocal tract
* flow of air initiated by creation of difference of air pressure between body and outside of body
* air flows from high to low pressure
* in speaking we take air into the body and change size of contained space
  * if space is contracted, air pressure inside body increases and creates **egressive airstream** (breath out)
  * if space expands, air pressure inside body decreases and creases **ingressive airstream** (breath in)
* airstream diagram
  * 0 represents outside air pressure (neutral)
  * egressive airstream represented with + isnide
  * ingressive represnted with -
* body part controlling
  * pulmonic (made with lungs)
  * glottatic (made by raising or lowering glottis)
  * velaric (made with air trapped infront of dorso alveolar closure)
* mechanisms
  * pulmonic egressive 
    * all languages in sounds like [p t k]
    * lungs compress
    * air goes out
  * pulmonic ingressive
    * rarely used phonemically
    * lungs expand
    * air goes in
    * in atlantic canada, inhale when saying yeah as phatic expression
  * glotallic egressive (ejectives)
    * close glottis and larynx raises
    * increase pressure in oral cavity
    * egressive stops and fricatives [p' t' k'] 
      * ejectives must be voiceless because glottis must be closed
    * steps in making k'
       1. back of tongue comes up to form velar closure
          glottis is closed
       2. closed glottis is raised
       3. body of air in pharynx is compressed
       4. back of tongue is lowered, releasing compressed pharynx air
       5. glottal closure release
    * allophonically at the end of words [like]
    * have 2 releases
      * period of silence between first and second
      * release of the front closure, then the glottal release
      * first release looks similar to a plosive release of same articulation but a bit louder
      * second release is more difficult to see, makign period of silence best clue
      * silence is generally 0.5 long
  * glottatic ingressive
    * lower glottis
    * decrease pressure
    * air flows in
    * implosives
      * usually voiced
      * glottis not held fully closed
      * moving air down and ambient air makes glottis vibrate
      * super voices consonants
    * steps in making [b] (bilabial implosive)
      1. closure of lips
      2. downward  movement of vibrating glottis (air from lungs continues to flow)
      3. little change in oral tract pressure
      4. lips come apart
    * transcribed with symbols similar to pulmonic stops but with rightward hook at top 
    * acoustics
      * look similar to voiced plosive of the same place of articulation
      * shorter than plosive counterparts
      * no easy consistent ways to tell voiced plosives and implosives apart
      * many languages only have one or the other
  * velaric ingressive
    * tongue makes dorso-velar closure
    * tongue pulled back and low, decreasing air pressure at the front
    * clicks
      * bilabial
        * kissy sound
      * dental
        * tsk tsk
      * alveolar
        * classic lick
      * lateral sound
        * 'callign a hourse'
      * palatal alveolar click
    * back of tongue raises to form closure
    * tongue tip goes up to form closure
    * body of tongue moves down decreasing air pressure in motuh
    * tongue tip lowers so air rushes into mouth
    * back closure released
    * acoustics
      * biliabial and dental click have softer release intensity
        * sides of cheek/teeth dampen or scatter the sound
      * alveolar, palatal and lateral click have loud intensity
      * lateral and dental have >= 0.02s release duration because air takes time to flow across teeth and tongues
      * biliabial click has variable release freqencies
      * dental, palatal, lateral have release freq > 2000Hz
      * alveolar click has < 2kHz release
      * lateral click has >= 0.05s because front of tongue needs to release, cf. 0.02s silence duration for other clicks
  * velaric egressive
    * not used in any languae
    * same as ingressive but tongue moves forward and up
