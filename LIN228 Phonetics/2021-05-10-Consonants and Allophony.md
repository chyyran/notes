## English Vowel Allophony
* Nasalization
  * Vowels become nasalized when they adjacent are to a nasal consonant
  * nasal sounds so far in this class: [m n ŋ]
  * air goes through nose through the velar pharyngeal port before and after a nasal consonant
  * happens more to the vowel in front, but less to the vowel after
  * happens after diphthongs, put nasalization tilde ~ over vowel of the digraph, like [aj]
  * does not change the meaning of the word (not constrastive) in English
* /æ/-raising
  * Before a velar consonant, in Canadian english, /æ/ becomes higher like *bag* [bæ̝g] or *sang* [sæ̝ŋ], cf. *bat* [bæt]
* Broad transcription / / includes all regular phonemic contrasts in Canadian English including
  * schwa in unstressed vowels
  * vowel distcintion before /ɹ/
  * primary stress
* Narrow transcription []
  * length
  * nasalization
  * canadian raising
  * ash-rasing
  * rhotic vowels
## Line drawings
* Don't differentiate between bunched and retroflex /ɹ/
* Assume central before everything else
* Articulations:
  * lat: lateral
  * ret: retroflex
  * dent: dental
  * p-a: palato-alveolar
  * pal: palatal/dorsal
* dorsal is for both palatal and velar sounds
* velic refers to the velic-opening
  * whether a sound is nasal or oral
  * oral sounda have closed velum
* can do broad and narrow transcription for line drawings
  * for example, showing lowered velum for nasalized vowels

## Consonant Allophony
* allophonic variation happens if two sounds are not contrastive
* two sounds that are contrastive (new meaning) are phonemes.
* example in English: [t ɾ tʰ] are all allophones of the phoneme /t/

## Connected speech
* segments are not often pronounced discreetly
  * begin producing next segment before finishing production of the next
  * causes processes because of 
    * efficiency: pronuunce more easily
    * distinction: allows people to distinguish word more easily
* this is why vowels become nasalized
  * velum does not finish closing before vowel production is begun
* most inherent sound processes are distinction
* most co-articulation processes are due to efficiency
* sociolinguistic processes may also occur to signal ones identity in speech

## Coarticulation
* "co-articulation": when multiple things move at the same time
* overlap
  * if two stops occur adjacent to one another, the closure for the second stop may be formed before the second stop is released.
  * apt /æpt/ becomes [æp͡t]
  * tongue is moved at the alveolar ridge and the closure is created before lips open up to release the bilabial t
* Yod coalescence:
  * can happen within words but more obvious **across word boundaries**
  * /j/ coalesces with **alveolar obstruents** to cause palatized affrication
  * ex
    * **get you** /gɛt ju/ -> ['gɛtʃu]
    * **miss you** /mɪs ju/ -> ['mɪʃu]

### Assimilation
* When a segment becomes more similar to the segments around it
  * place, manner, or voicing
* **dentalization**
  * alveolars (/t d n l/) are realized as dental when they occur **before the dental fricatives** /θ ð/
  * tenth /tɛnθ/ -> [tɛn̪θ]
* **labiodental nasals**
  * bilabial /m/ is realized as labialdental [ɱ] before the labiodental fricatives /f v/
  * symphony /sɪmfəni/ [sɪɱfəni]
* **retroflexion**
  * alveolars become retroflex following /ɹ/
    * /həɹt/ becomes [hɚʈ]
      * notice r-coloured schwa
  * /t d/ before /ɹ/ become retroflex affricates
    * tree /tɹi/ -> [ʈʂɹi]
    * dream /dɹim/ -> [ɖʐɹim]
  * speakers who usually make retroflex /ɹ/ might used a bunched /ɹ/ after velars such as in crate and green. bunched /ɹ/ speakers may keep the tongue tip up (retroflex) after alveolar stops; tree, drain
    * bunched r is usually easier after velar consonants
* **velar fronting**
  * velar consonants are produced with an articulation further towards the front of the month when they precede a front vowel
    * key /ki/ -> [k̟i], compared to car /kɑɹ/ [kɑɹ]
* **rounding**
  * consonants are pronouned with lip rounding when they precede round vowels
    * kit /kɪt/ -> [kɪt] compared to cool /kul/ -> [kʷul]
      * ʷ is labialization (lip rounding)
* **allophones of /h/**
  * /h/ is realized as a voiced/murmured [ɦ] between vowels
    * ahead /əhɛd/ -> [əɦɛd] (the glottal fricative here is voiced)
  * /h/ is realized as the pallatal fricative [ç] before /j/ 
    * human /hjumən/ -> [çjumən]
    * this is a type of yod-coalescence within a word
    * the frication stops happening at the glottis but in the palate instead
* **inherent rounding**
  * In Canadian English, some consonants are pronounced with rounding no matter what vowels come after them
  * This is a differentiation change
  * Postalveolars [ʃʷ tʃʷ ʒʷ dʒʷ]
  * /ɹ/ in onsets becomes [ɹʷ] such as in *red*
  * retroflex affricates before /ɹ/ is also rounded
    * [ʈʂʷɹʷi] or [ɖʐʷɹʷim]
    * the retroflex affricates are inherently rounded in English, but retroflex affricates only occur before /ɹ/
* **yod-dropping**
  * in Canadian English, speakers don't pronounce [j] in a stressed syllable with a coronal consonant followed by /ju/
    * *new* /nu/ vs /nju/
    * *sue* /su/ vs /sju/
    * *tune* /tun/ vs /tjun/
  * we show this in the broad transcription because it is so consistent
* **homorganic nasals**
  * in general, nasal consonants assimilate to the place of articutation of a following consonant.
  * broad transcriptions should include /m/ before labials and /ŋ/ before velars
    * impossible /ɪm'pɑsɘbɘl/ (underlying in- possible, but it becomes assimilated phonetically)
    * ankle /'æŋkəl/

## Syllable dependent allophonic variation
* These processes are mostly to do with distinction
* **Syllabic consonants**
  * Recall r-colored schwa as in *her* /hər/ [hɚ]
    * [ɚ] can also be written as [ɹ̩]
  * Sometimes, sonorants (nasals and liquids) may function as nucleus
    * sudden /sʌdən/ [sʌdn̩]
    * buckle /bʌkəl/ [bʌkɫ̩]
* **Dark and light /l/**
  * the lateral approximant /l/ becomes **dark** in syllable codas
  * the tongue dorsum is raised towards the velum in syllable final /l/ [ɫ]
  * ex:
    * tell /tɛl/ -> [tɛɫ]
    * let /lɛt/ -> [lɛt]
* **Aspiration**
  * voiceless stops are aspirated at the beginning of a **stressed** syllable
  * ex:
    * pit /pɪt/ [pʰɪt] vs spit /spɪt/ [spɪt]
* **Devoicing**
  * Approximants are devoiced when they follow aspirated stops
  * ex:
    * play /plej/ [pʰl̥ej] vs splay /splej/ [splej]
  * liquids also devoiced
    * craft [kʰræft]
* **Word-final devoicing**
  * **voiced obstruents** are **partially devoiced** in word-final position
  * written by doubling the final consonant, with the last one as devoiced
  * ex:
    * fuzz /fʌz/ [fʌzz̥]
    * spid /spʌd/ [spʌdd̥]
* **tapping**
  * /t d/ may be realized as a voiced alveolar tap [ɾ] between vowels and **the second vowel is unstressed**
  * ex:
    * city /sɪti/ [sɪɾi]
    * body /bɑdi/ [bɑɾi]
  * /nt/ between vowels is also often realized as a nasal tap
    * winter /wɪntəɹ/ [wɪɾ̃ɚ]
* **glottal stop**
  * may occur as an allophone of /t/ as in button [bʌʔn̩]
    * not super common in Canadian English
  * usually not phonemic in English, but is optionally present before a vowel utterance
    * uh-oh [ʔʌʔow]
