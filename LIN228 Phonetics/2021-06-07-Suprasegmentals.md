# 2021-06-07 Suprasegmentals

## VOT
* aspiration = positive VOT
* voicing = stop + immediate vowel/low freq voice before stop release
* fric + stop = 0 VOT cause voicing is not preempted 
  * in english, need fric + unasp stop like stye/spy
* voicing is on a continuum
  * not quite just voiced/voiceless
  * some languages have 4 way distinction for voicing
## Pitch and Suprasegmentals
* effect that affects more than 1 segment
  * stress
  * loudness
  * pitch
* pitch+intensity+length = stress
* languages have different types of stress
* pitch can be used contrastively = tone language
* can mark stress but no intensity/length, just pitch
* english stress change
  * depending on stress words can mean N or V
  * verbs have stress on s2
    * produce
    * survey
* types of stress
  * lexical (not predictable)
    * english
    * russian
  * fixed
    * french: final stress 
* tone
  * pitch not for stress
  * tonal languages more common than non tonal languages
  * WALS sampling bias looks makes it look like non-tonal is more prevalent than it is 
  * simple vs complex tone
    * simple = 2 way contrast + register contrast (H/L)
    * complex = 3 way+ register contrast and countours
  * use F0 changes phonemically
  * speakers of tonal languages have broader F0 range than non-tonal
  * natural f0 range of english vs mando speakers
* register tones are level tones (H/L/M)
* contour tones have rising/falling tones (start high move low, start low move high etc)
  * a language with any contour tones is a contour tone language
* pitch ranges relative to speakers individual F0
  * pitch contours is the same but f0 can change
  * perception is for relative frequency and how it changes
  * have to decide for each speaker what counts as high or low
  * must be done very quickly
* pitch accent
  * simple tone system
  * general tone pattern
  * lexical accent that overrides overall pattern
  * tonal pattern marks stress
  * lexical accent = strsedd syllable
  * japanese 
    * default LHH 
    * lexical accent pattern of HLL..
    * sullables lexicallly specified for tone
    * others receive tone by default fron egneral pattern
* intonation
  * grammatical/emotional meaning of an utterance
  * patterns of pitch changes
  * *tonic* syllable is the main stressed syllable in a phrase
* wh-qs in english don't usually have rising intonation in beginning
  * varies in dialect
* rising/rising/rising/fallign for list
* near universals
  * falling: neutral statement, wh-syllable, command
  * rising: tentative, yes/no, request
  * tone languages have same contours but on top of word-specific tonal patterns
