* types of voicing
* States of the glottis
  * glottal stop
    * entire glottis is closed and no air can pass through
  * voiceless sounds
    * partially open and far enough apart for air to pass through without vibration
    * many languages have both voiced and voiceless
    * all languages have voiceless obstruents
    * most voiceless sounds have their own symbols
    * usually voiced sound voiceless is transcribed with a circle diacritic
  * modal voice
    * regular voicing
    * vocal foltds are vibrating
    * vocal folds repeatedly come to gether and open allowing air to escape in short bursts
    * not snapped shut
  * whisper

    * quiet voice voiceless sounds and quiet whisper sounds which would otherwise be voiced
  * breathy voice
    * murmur
    * vibration but also breathiness
    * produced by positioning vocal folds far enough apart so that they do not close completely when vibrating
    * laryngitis causes this
    * breathy-voiced /h/ occurs intervocalically in english
    * diacritic for breathy-voice is two dots
    * for breathy-voiced stops vocal folds assume breathy-voiced position following the release of the stop 
    * stop itself as regular voicing
  * creaky voice
    * vocal fry
