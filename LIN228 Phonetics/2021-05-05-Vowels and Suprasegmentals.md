## Vowels
* Vowels are assumed to be voiced and oral
* Nasal and voiceless vowels can be marked using diacritics (tilde and bottom circle respectively)
* Vowels are classified by backness/frontness, height, and rounding (of lips)
* Rounded back vowels and unrounded front vowels are very common crosslinguistically
  * Same case in English, all English front vowels are unrounded with most back vowels rounded
  * Rounding the lips make the vocal tract slightly longer, so rounding your lips makes a sound further back, **because it elongates the front of the vocal tract**
  * Rounded back vowels are extra-back, while unrounded front vowels are extra-front which is easier for contrast
* Cardinal vowels
  * specific point on the IPA vowel chart quad
  * vowel space is continous, so it's just coincidence if a language's vowels happen to line up with a cardinal vowel
  * linguists use the symbol that is closest to the average pronunciation of a particular vowel in a given language

## Phonetic Methods
* Electropalatography
  * Uses an artificial palate to track the contact of the tongue with roof of mouth
* While generally vowels don't have much constriction, some vowels have some contact
  * Generally the more high the vowel the more contact
  * Glides only exist for high vowels because high vowels have more constriction

## Syllables
* Syllables are divided into three parts
  * Onset
  * Nucleus
  * Coda
* Position of a consonant within a syllable has an effect on the way its pronounced.
* Type of vowel in the nucleus also has an effect
* Rime/Rhyme is the Nucleus + Coda
* Minimal syllable is just the nucleus
* The way sounds are allowed are called phonotactics
  * In English, /kw/ is allowed in the onset but not the coda
    * /kwin/ vs /*nikw/
  * Prohibited sound combinations are **systemic gaps**
  * Sound combinations that are allowed but not present are **accidental gaps**


## Canadian English Vowels
* Monophthongs
  * Tongue is in a steady position throughout the whole vowel
  | *    | Front | Central | Back |
  | ---- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
  | High | i ɪ   |         | u ʊ  |
  | Mid  | ε     | ʌ       |      |
  | Low  | æ     |         | ɑ    |
  * Caught-cot merger
    * Low-back vowels got merged. /ɒ/ and /ɔ/ got merged into /ɑ/
* Diphthongs
  * In Canadian English
    * `[aj]` goes from low-central to high-front
    * `[aw]` goes from low-central to high-back
    * `[ɔj]` goes from mid-back to high-front
    * `[ej]` goes from mid-front to high-front
    * `[ow]` goes from mid-back to high-back
  * In this class, we will write dipthongs as vowel + glide
  * `[ɔj]` and `[ow]` have slightly different initial vowels in Canadian English
* English vowels are distinguished between *tense* and *lax*
  * These terms do not imply physiological difference i.e. the toungue is not more tense or lax depending on the vowel
  * Naming is just a category which behave differently in English phonotactics
  * Tense Vowels: /i ej aj aw u ow ɑ ɔj ɔ/
  * Lax Vowels: /ɪ ε æ ʌ ʊ ə/
    * ə is a special case
  * Tense vowels can occur in **open** (without coda) or **closed** syllables (with coda)
  * Lax vowels can only occur in **closed** syllables
  * ə can occur in open syllables but is classified as a lax vowel.
    * sofa [sowfə]
*** Tense vowels and dipthongs are always longer than lax vowels**
  * This is called **inherent length**
  * In narrow transcription, marked with a raised dot for monopthongs, and a cluster in dipthongs
* **Context can cause lengthening**
  * When vowels occur before a voiced consonant or in syllable-final position, vowels are lengthened.
  * Also marked with a raised dot in narrow transcription
  * If a vowel already has inherent length, then both dots are used.
  * Dipthongs use a raised dot **in between the cluster** to show contextual lengthening.
* **Only stressed vowels get length**
* Only some vowels can occur before /ɹ/
  * /ɪ ε ɑ ɔ ʊ aj aw ɔj/
  * Before syllable-final /ɹ/, there is no contrast between vowels that have the same specification for height and backness, like /i ɪ/ and /u ʊ/
    * The convention is to use the lower sound: fear /fɪr/
  * In Canadian English, [o ow ɔ] are also not contrastive before /r/
    * We use /ɔ/ to transcribe this sound.
    * Words like 'her' have a rhoticized/r-coloured vowel [ɚ] rather than separate [ər]
* Canadian raising
  * /aj/ and /aw/ begin at a higher place of articulation when they occur before voiceless obstruents in Canadian English
  * cf. wife [wʌjf] and wives [wajvz]
## Stress
* The impression that a listener has that one syllable is more prominent than others
* In English
  * Greater loudness
  * Higher pitch
  * Greater length
* Primary stress is indicated with a raised tick before the stressed syllable
* Secondary stress is indicated with the bottom tick
* [ʌ] and [ə] are both mid central vowels. [ə] only occurs in **unstressed** syllables, and ʌ occurs in **stressed** syllables
  * Vowels are often *reduced* to [ə]
  * [ə] can be transcribed in stressed syllables when followed by /ɹ/

## Transcription
* There is no one single transcription of a word
* We can abstract away differences and handwave over differences in a transcription
* **Narrow** (phonetic) transcriptions capture as much detail as possible for a **single** utterance
  * Diacritics can be used to make very subtle distinctions between sounds
  * [square brackets]
* A **Broad** transcription (phonemic transcription) captures enough aspects of a pronounciation to show how that word differs from other in a language.
  * Only captures phoneme differences
  * /slash brackets/

## Phonemes
* Two sounds are contrastive if they can create difference in meaning in a given language
* Constrastive sounds are called **phonemes**
* not all sounds that occur in a language 
* Sounds that do not contrast are allophones of one phoneme
