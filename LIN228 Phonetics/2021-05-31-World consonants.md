# 2021-05-31 World consonants

## Tiny's vocalization
* formants were much higher than human
* smaller = higher freq
## Place of Articulation
* described consonants
  * place
  * manner
  * voicing
  * airstream mechanism
  * airstream direction
* today we focus on pulmonic egressive sounds
* wher in the vocal tract is the airstream restricted
  * labial - one or both lips
  * coronal - tip or blade of tongue
  * dorsal - front of back of tongue
* places
  * labial
    * most langs have bilabial stops and ansals
          * labiodental frics mcuh more common than bilabkla
          * transitions going into labiodent consonant, f1 f2 point down like bilabial
          * almost looks like a stop but has voicing
          * labial frics only have light noise
          * labiodental direct air against teeth so its a little bit louder
            * cf bilabial fricatives not as loud
    * bilabial
      * constriction between two lips
      * stops and nasals common x-linguistiocally
      * bilabial fricatives
        * don't touch
        * very similar to labiodental
        * important to look at speaker
      * in ewe bilabial + labiodental fricatives are contrastive
    * labiodental
      * labiodental nasal /ɱ/ allophinuically when /m/ occurs before /f/ and /v/
      * lips + teeth
      * complete stops in theory possible but not attested
        * hard to do without intact teeth        
    * **linguolabial**
      * made with tip or blade of tongue contacting the upper lip
      * easy to pronounce but extremely rare
      * represented by diacritic [̼̼̼t̼]
      * dont have their own symbol
      * v'enen taut has phonemic ontrast
  * coronal
    * dental
      * interdental fricatives quite rare for english
      * voiced and voiceless stops are copmmon at dental
      * most langs have either dental or alveolar, they pick one
        * lol not english
    * alveolar
      * /t d n s z l/ made with tongue tip constrict with alveolar ridge
      * siome langs contrast dental and alveolar places of articulation in stop series
      * in some cases one place of articulation often laminal and other is apical
        * apical - apex of tongue (tip)
        * laminal - blade of tongue
      * can have laminal or apical alveolar stops 
    * postalveolar
      * have them in english
      * very common xlinguistically
      * alveolar vs postaveolar
        * produced with variety of tongue shapes
        * cant be given clear articularly difeinition
        * airstream produced in /s z/ hits upper teeth while /ʃ ʒ/ hits back of lower teeth
        * airstream direction causes sound
    * alveolo-palatal
      * formed with tongue tip behind lower teeth and blade forming constiction with back of alveolar ridge
      * poluish makes ontrast between alvewolar, alveolo-palatal, and retroflex fricatives
      * /ɕ ʑ/
    * retroflex
      * curling the tongue back and create constiction between tongue tip and area bordering alveolar ridge and hard palate
      * lowering F2 of adjacent vowels
  * dorsal
    * front back or root of the tongue
      * common to use this term to only refer to sounds made with back (dorsum) of the tongue
    * palatals made with front of the tongue and **pattern** with coronals phonologically in some langs and dorsals in others
    * palatals
      * made with front of the tongue and hard palate
      * tongue tip is usually poitning down sometimes against back teeth
      * only palatal phoneme in english is /j/
      * english has palatal allophones
        * /h/ -> /ç/
      * palatal nasals occur in french and spanish (senor)
      * voiced & voiceless palatal stops present in Twi
      * German has a voiceless palatal fricative that contrasts with the postanveolar fricative
      * /にゃ/
  * dorsal
    * dorso-velar sounds made with dorsol contact/approac velum
      * voiced voiceless nasal velar stops familiar from english
      * voiced and voiceless eelar frics present in some langs
    * dorso-uvular formed by forming constriction with dorsum of the tongue uvula
      * present in scottish as in *loch*
    * pharyngeal
      * move root of the tongue towards back of pharynx and create a constiction between root and pharyngeal wall
      * difficult to produce complete closure
      * fricatives only types of pharyngeal segments from xlinguistically
        * arabic has voiced and voiceless
  * glottal stops
    * produced by holding vocal folds together
    * complete blockage of airflow at vocal folds
    * other glottal consonants are /h/ and /ɦ/
      * phonolgocailly /h/ is a consonant but most accurately described as voiceless vowel
        * /ɦ/ is a breathy voiced vowel
## Double and Secondary Articulations
* two simultanoeous articulation of same manner at two diff places
  * labial-velar
    * slides
    * kp/gb
  * labial-alveolr
    * pt/bd
  * postalveolar-velar
    * ɧ
* secondary articulation
  * main constriction + secondary constriction
  * adding vowel quality to consonant
  * ex
    * labialization
      * [u]
      * +diacritic (w)
    * palatalization
      * [i]
      * +diacritic (j)
    * velarization
      * [ɤ]
      * +diacritic (ɤ)
    * phraryngealisation
      * [ɑ]
      * +diacritic (ʕ)
  * languages dont often have both velarization and pharyngealisation so we use same diacritic to use both like [ɫ]
## Manner of articulation
* stops, fricatives, approx. have more to less closure
* vowels have at most closure made for [i]
* affricates are a stop + homorganic fricative
  * releasing the stop in a fricative manner
  * stop and fricative has to be in a similar place
* glides
  * moving vowels   
  * [j w ɰ ɥ]
  * [j] -> high front unrounded
  * [w] -> high back rounded
  * [ɥ] -> high front rounded
  * [ɰ] -> high back unrounded
* rhotics
  * r-like sounds
  * [ɹ] alveolar approximant
  * [ɻ] retroflex approximant
  * [ʁ] alveolar approximant
  * [r] apical trill
  * [ʀ] uvular trill
  * [ɾ] voiced apical tap
* trill
  * manner where articulator vibrates against another in rapid series of colosures and release
  * use bernoulli effect
  * much like how voicing works
  * [r] apical trill
  * [ʀ] uvular trill
  * [ʙ] bilabial trill
* tap
  * lower articulator strikes upper articulartor in rapid closure and release
  * [ɾ] voiced apical tap
* flap
  * articulation where articulator beginds in one position, strikes plce of articulation in passing zand ends in diff position
  * [ɽ] voiced retroflex flap
* laterals
  * [l] alveolar approx.
  * [ɭ] retroflex approx.
  * [ʎ] palatal approx.
  * [ʟ] velar approx.
  * [ɬ ɮ] voiceless/voiced alveolar lat. fric
  * liquid lateral or rhotic
* [ʋ] labial-dental approx.
* nasal
  * complete closure of oral cavity
  * velum lowered and passing through nasal cavity
  * prenasalzied stop
    * short homoorganic nasal preceeding stop
    * stop closure made in oral cavity
    * soft palate lowered
    * soft palate raised to form a stop
  * nasalized click
    * click can be made with simultaneous nasal airflow
