## Character in Narrative

* characters strongly **resemble** real people
  * but they are not real
  * fictional construct evaluated within an artificial world
  * created in text, can not be evaluated within the real world
* what do we **need** a character for?
  * characters exist for a reason in narrative
  * reasons
    * synthetic: visibly constructed
    * mimetic: most person-like
      * sense of real is different
      * normative vis-a-vis nonnormative
      * does not have to be human in species
    * thematic: exist to fulfill social roles or represent an idea
* personal preferences vs narrative purpose
* flat vs round
  * reduction of a human to the mechanical
  * exist on the surface of a story along with **objects and machines**
  * degrees of depth and complexity
    * can not be summed up in a single phrase
  * are we underreading?
  * all characters are a bit flat/squashed because they are not real
  * deciding this is **hard!**
* (archi)"type" character
  * limiting a character to a type denies their capacity to surprise us (abbott 132)
  
* character vs action
  * is what important who the character is, or what they do?
  * henry james: character and action are indistinguishable
    * western mode of thought (invested in the ego)
  * characters are harder to understand than action
  * narratives most challenging gaps
    * piece of the narrative not given by the text
  * sometimes characters dont act
  * readers who are immersed will almost **always** lend extra characteristics
    * our reading history (temperamental disposition) will shape our idea of the character
* programmer has to write NPC dialogue 
  * suggestive and interpretive dialogue
* external actions easy to spot, but we must infer **inside** character
  * can't entirely open up a human
  * a lot of it is inferring about ourselves
  * inferring other people, other characters
* character in games
  * three different things
    * interactive representations of the player
    * fictional entities thats serve to advance the story
    * **proprietary symbols of the game franchise (game as a product)**
* ludic vs representational
  * ludic: game piece, allows the game to be played
  * representational: represents some human
  * ludic queen, i.e. chess 
  * representational queen, toriel
    * actions in the underworld
    * identity
  * (playable) queen and princess characters
    * a lot less frequent than you would expect
  * identifying with character as an extension of self, vs relating to it as a separate fictional entity
* player-character vs npc
  * wide range
  * flat/round/generic/mechanical
* SPARTANS are representation of a franchise (Halo)
* some characters are meant to die
  * "reach noble team cutscenes" -> "all noble team death scenes" (google)
* papyrus is the jar jar binks of undertale
* mechanical change of character
  * skill tree
    * changing skills may change how the story plays out
  * cosmetic changes
    * haircut, clothes
* is a change meaningful?
  * male or female noble six
  * what quests you decide to go on
  * how characters change based on co-creation
* blank slate vs preonceived
  * we are filling in some notions of a character
  * role becomes scriptable
    * the player is participating in meaningmaking
* character vs avatar
  * '*avatara*' visible, physical form of hindu gods
  * reverse action in video games
    * hinduism: incarnation, from virtual to physical
    * online: physical to virtual, decarnation
  * continuum
    * avatars function as projection of the player
    * character have strong fictional identies separate from the player
    * not uniform
    * avatar allows us to play with identity
    * avatars and characters are polymorphous
    * "slider self"
    * multiple identies
* fundamentally, character will never be everything
  * will never capture all it means to be human.
  * where is it our work and where is it given to us by the text?
  * how are we influenced by our reading history, zeigeist? 


* assumptions of how realism works
  * realism and inertia
  * weapon handling looks 'real' despite never having those weapons
  * realism as a constructed, imagined space

* avatar: identify as
* character: identify with
