    * 6-8 primary texts
    * 3 critical sources
      * can propose more
  * Rationale due apr 
    * what do video games make us ask?
    * questionful pieces of media
    * what do video games narratives make us ask in an **English** course?
* Interpretation is a form of "closure" that is an assertion of meaning (Abbott 87)
  * what does it mean for **something to happen in this way**
  * as readers, we are the interpreter, we exercise a power in how to interpret a text
  * without our cooperation narratives do not come to life
  * the most **difficult** feeling is a **state of uncertainty**
  * we'll often try to give it meaning, even if it means _underreading_ (ignoring certain aspects), or _overreading_ (adding certain aspects not present)
  * overreading frequently cued by the masterplots (abbott 89)
    * be aware of how our reading is influenced by our history
    * is it intertext, paratext, or our own reading history?
  * assumption that narrative is a whole
    * this is not necessarily true
    * all narratives are necessarily incomplete (abbott 101)
      * we are as self-contradictory as stories are
  * real author is a complex, continually changing individual
  * implied author is the sensibility that 'accounts' for the narrative
    * video games can have thousands of hands in their creation (eg. what does 'naughty dog' mean as an individual??)
    * implied author is a construct, we *develop our own idea* of an implied author
    * easily be called an **inferred author**
    * reader + reader community come together to form such a construct paratextually
    * what is the creative idea?
  * abbott's three kinds of interpretation
    * Intentional
      * work from what you guess the implied author is trying to do
      * treat text like a puzzle that a creator has set out
      * doesn't work well for many txts, especially games
    * Adaptive
    * Symptomatic
      * narrative is seen to express symptomatically the conditions out of which it comes (abbott 105)
      * less about what the creative consciousness is planning, but more about how the "world creates the author"
      * "act" of reading a text

    * includes non-human animals
  * belief structures
  * crip theory (abilities, disabilities)
  * queer theory (gender, sexuality)
* may be right or wrong, but that doesn't matter
  * your interpretation might be one that the implied author might not agree with
  * this is what important psychologically or socially
  * author may not agree with reading, that *might be support for it*!
* we have different worlds, how do we provide the 'best reading'? most ethical reading
  * balancing act
  * assembling pieces of evidence
  * put evidence in scale, see if evidence fits with concern  you have
