# 2021-03-02 Perspective

* assumption that narratives are whole
* actual process of interpretation is done by readers
  * all narratives are incomplete
* video games create avatarial bodies
  * think about life through a different lens
  * we are not 'one person'
* matters of perspective
  * perspective is about control in narrative
  * narrator viewpoint
  * implied author viewpoint (text)
    * constructed idea
  * implied reader
    * who is this text for?
    * intended audience
  * actual reader
    * might not be aligned with the implied reader
  * drama does not have one individual narrator
    * each character is presenting their piece
    * reader assembles
  * film
    * perspective of camera
    * but camera may not be conscienceness
  * videogames??
    * narrator/reader/control breaks down 
* narrative time
  * narrator in the moment?
  * flashback? recollection?
  * videogames tear this apart
    * time becomes an always now
    * always in a sense doing it now
    * time may extend narratively but narrative moment is always now
* map of perspective that is known
* who is the controlling viewpoint?
* first person
  * in games, fp perspective operates differently
  * player becomes the lens with which we see the world
  * may be an external voiceover
  * player is able to control what they see 
  * myst
    * all you see is the pointer finger
    * avatarial point of presence
    * relatively inflexible camera
    * ghostliness for the player
    * observe with relative freedom, small scale effects
    * barred from the *fake*, illusory coporeality
    * diegesis where player could not die at risk of any more than frustration
    * **you never see the character**, no sense of a body
* epistolary form
  * narrative assembled by different voices
  * voices in written, recorded elements
  * reader-player is assembling the narrative from pieces of text
  * first things is the bookshelf
  * keybooks
  * tlou: recordings
  * puzzle pieces, epistolary pieces
  * reading someone's diary
    * voyerism!
    * power that you're not supposed to have
  * what is virtual? what is real
* unreliable narrator
  * **not a value jugdment**
  * **not an accusation of lying**
  * writer is deliberately exploiting the readers awareness
  * narrator or character is **misunderstanding or confused** about the going-on inside the story world
  * whole lens of the story is warped through unreliability
  * challenging device o use
* any actor or avatar in a game has goals
  * to accomplish this goals, players must develop **X-ray vision**
  * focused to a point that you see through or past these details
    * witcher senses
    * lock on 
    * z-targeting!
    * listen mode
  * picking and choosing what to see and focus on in order to solve a problem
  * choose to look past certain things
  * underreading or overreading
  * power to interpret the world
  * statis, unreliable
  * meta, mindful thinking
    * strategy allows to see everything we need, but we can move past that
* second-person
  * 'you'
  * kind of normal in a game
  * d&d
  * video game lineage
* third person
  * you see the avatar
  * you see all the surrounding environment
  * top-down, overhead games have a pronounced separation between the player and separation of the game
  * objective view of the game world
  * separation between character and the character you're playing
  * **objective** (?) view of the gameworld
    * how does that associate with the player-character?
    * so much of undertale is about subjectivity
    * how you decide to be in the world
  * third person perspective in a game reveals that there is a split 
    * self-as-observer
    * self-as-observed
    * we already do this in our heads
    * we can watch ourselves play
    * view of identity
  * sense of self, a way to imagine ourself when living as ourselves
  * camera in tw3
    * camera spins to watch geralt's face
  * split between control
    * joel's actions vs players action
    * be part of that decision but you didn't make it
    * plenty of us who disagree, plenty who agree
  * variations on third person
    * god games
      * civ, sims
    * avatar not presented on the screen
    * power but no body
    * animal crossing
    * your town or city
    * civ not quite omniscient, fog of war
      * god game, but narratively not quite omniscient
    * assasins creed is not a god game but
      * your camera, etc is focalized
      * a lot of control, who is seeing, circumstances
      * movement, third person games
  * focalized
    * androids in detroit
    * player's understanding between control of interface and avatar's obedience
    * embrace the avatar as an **ideal or reject it as an inferior other**
    * android both human and tool
    * avatar yells at you for making you do things
* what's pleasureable about playing as avatar
  * you do a thing, thing happens
    * not necessarily in the real world
  * reflection of personal agency
  * continual response to their actions
  * to feel your avatar gliding, sliding, flying
  * your **body** responding
* avatar does double duty as self and other, symbol and index
  * can accomplished by more than the player alone
  * limited and freed by the player
  * supernatural power, can shape their world
  * ambassadors of agency
  * strong structural comparison 
    * witcher 3: super strong male, parenthood
    * tlou joel: surrogacy, newer
    * sense of supernaturalness! (joel's rugged survival man)
      * joel surviving sepsis from being kebabed
  * avatars can live, die, and live again
    * bodies dissolve, get destroyed, only to reappear
    * all avatars are supernatural
* games that deliberately acknowledge death
  * undertale
  * journey
* avatar gives us perspectives, values, and tools
* joel's goals, noble 6's goals
* start to invest in the avatar body
* avatars represent an idealized self
* geralt wants you to look at thim
* gaze, desire
* ellie: playing as ellie but also watching her play
