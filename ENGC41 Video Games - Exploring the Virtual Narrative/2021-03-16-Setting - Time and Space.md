# 2021-03-16 Setting - Time and Space

* narratives of any length build with all four dimensions of time and space
* chracters have inner worlds of their own that bleed out in the narrative
* narrative is 'the art of making and understanding a world'
  * story is a world
* narrative world is its own world
  * might resemble our world **but it is not ours**
  * wholly constructed space
  * fabricated, reality is no defense for fiction
  * we can't test them against the real world
* "realism" is an artistic form
  * a real looking world is still constructed
* farah mendelsohn
  * the fantastic is an area of literature heavily dependent on the dialectic between author and reader for the construction of a sense of wonder
  * the reader is participating in the construction of time and space
* time and space
  * discourse time == szujet time vs story time == fabula time
  * on the page
  * in the reader's mind
  * chronotope -- time and space are connnected
    * intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships expressed in literature
    * chronotope strongly correlates with genre (keen 96)
      * fairy tales are always "once upon a time"
      * noir -- someone in the US, mid 30s
    * the penelepoid
      * "Where shall I begin"
      * "real beginning"
    * "distant past, near future"
* when does time matter in a video game?
  * when is there a timer?
  * geralt going off to play gwent for 3 days
  * some games show you time as its passing
  * time sensitivity
  * decision timers
* 'time' has little to do with historical time
  * temporal unfolding of act of reading
  * duration of time depicted in the plot
  * pace at which narration relates event
  * time is about how the story is presented
* game narratives
  * cut to black
    * fabula time does not match szujet time
    * is the reader being aske to fill in these gaps in fabula time?
    * szujet time often the quantity of pages
* reader time
  * how long does it take for the reader to absorb whats happening?
  * how long is reading speed? how long it takes to complete the story?
  * reader's sense of 'slow' or 'fast' has more to do with how many pages are turned and how fast

    * how many lives are spent during a play session?
    * other people do not have the same perspective as you
  * stop and come back to it
* space
  * we want access to the world
  * often a neglected area of narrative study
