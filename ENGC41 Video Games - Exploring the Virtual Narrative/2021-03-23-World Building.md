# 2021-03-23 World Building

* different kind of built worlds
* narrative world is an artificial constructed space
  * want to make it seem real, but it is not
* animal crossing
  * Sense of accomplishment once you have built it
  * control, agency
* transmedia
  * familiarity of worlds to explore
* weight allowance
  * breaks suspension of disbelief?
  * environment is interactive
  * not just backdrop
* geralt is in possession of this world
  * he is old, belongs in the world
  * world does not surprise him
  * player 
  * art itself being portal
  * signifier of immersive fantasy/portal fantasy
    * "what is this place"
  * geralt 'hates portals'
    * concept of portals is not foreign to him
* 'doors exponentially complicate the logic of a game'
  * doorways are literally liminal
* *setting vs genre*
  * settings can feel simple in some stories
  * media can create the illusion of physically travelling
  * setting can affect recollection so deeply
    * "ive been there"
  * sometimes setting doesn't matter that much
  * in speculative fiction, setting might be crucial for genre
  * even minimalist settings betray the genre
* laws of nature
  * choosing a setting means deciding on the physical laws of the universe
* homes aren't passive environments
  * interaction is worldbuilding
