# 2021-02-25 SSL

* ensures packets passing through untrusted routers are secure
* Secure Sockets Layer designed by Netscape in 1996
* SSL v3 *standard* is called TLS
* Commonly used to secure web sessions
  * can be used to secure any socket
* requires application at both ends
  * end-to-end security
* sits in application layer, typically a library
* two phases
  * handshake (key exchange)
    * establishes SSL version
    * sets up secret key between send, recv
    * perfoms authentication
    * happens once for any exchange, but relatively expensive
  * communication
    * any number of messages can be exchanged after handshake
    * large amounts of data can be transmitted so must be efficient.
  * handshake phase
    * establish suite of supported ciphers
    * what versions of TLS protocol
    * authenticates party identities via cert
      * auths machine ident, not users
      * client machine auth is optional, not usually done for every SSL interaction
    * steps:
      * client: hello
        * indicates supported SSL versions and supported ciphers
        * plaintext
          * ssl version
          * session id
          * cipher suite
          * compression support
          * **random value 1**
        * possible for downgrade attack
          * attacker changes SSL hello to only support some very weak cipher
      * server: hello
        * plaintext
          * ssl version
          * cipher to use
          * session id
          * compression support
          * **random value 2**
        * server chooses SSL version and cipher
      * server: certificate
        * attaches cert
        * may request client cert
        * client must check server cert validity and **CN (FQDN)**
          * if you don't check you can attack to fake websites with valid cert
      * server: hello done
      * client: certificate
        * only sent if requested
        * server validates and checks CN
        * not really common for web browsers
        * applications
          * IOT devices
          * secure apps with known clients
      * client: key exchange
        * creates random value called **pre-master secret**
        * encrypts with server pubkey from server cert
        * server decrypts pre-master secret
      * server, client: compute master secret
        * server and client use pre-master secret, RV1, and RV2 to compute **master secret**
        * if RVs werent there, key exchange could have been repeated
        * prevents replay attacks
        * if attackers MITM RV, then master secret would be mismatched
      * client: finish
        * send MAC of all previous messages + client session ID
        * server verifies MAC
      * server: finish
        * send mac of all previous messages + server session ID
        * client verifies MAC
    * features
      * protects against spoofing by MAC at the end
      * protects against reorder, deletion
        * handshake messages as each side as one packet, must be in the correct order
      * protects against replay
        * handshake cannot be replayed due to nonces
      * protects against MITM
        * certs use to authenticate pubkeys
  * communication
    * break message into fragments
    * compress
    * add HMAC of compressed fragment + sequence number
    * encrypt using master key
    * add SSL record header with sequence number
      * 64-bit long sequence number, acts as a good nonce
  * performance issues
    * data is encrypted using semantic block cipher
    * handshake is expensive (asym cipher is 1000x worse than sym cipher)
    * want to avoid lots of SSL handshakes
      * hardware accel can be offloaded
      * hardware can perform pubkey ops
